crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,Natanael_L,108,1686521901.0,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

We now think it's impossible to stay in Reddit unless the current reddit admins are forced to change their minds (very unlikely). We're now actively considering our options. Reddit may own the URL, but they do not own the community."

I was wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on inserting TDA into the world of cryptography. Whether it be a whole new cryptographic system or a smaller application.

Still on the cypherpunk mailing list in 2000 under his dnet .com email

Wrote a manifesto in 2001 about making a mark without leaving a trace

Subscriber to cryptome.org in 2001


Early Signs of a Bitcoin-like Mindset

In 2003, Dorsey posted a bio mentioning his interest in crypto, pseudonyms, and 4 AM hacks

That same year, he declared he was ending his dependence on the U.S. dollar and was creating a barter network

Used the pseudonym ""Jak"" instead of Jack


Suspiciously Timed Events Around Bitcoin’s Birth

August 17, 2008: Jack, an avid sailor, tweets: ""Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way."" Bitcoin.org is registered the next day.

His Twitter bio from Sept '07 - Jan '09 mentioned that he was a sailor.

The original Bitcoin source code contains an old sailor’s adage: ""Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.""

Bitcoin’s source code documents were timestamped at exactly 4 AM, aligning with Jack’s known hacking hours.

Bitcoin’s source code includes a brute-forced vanity address starting with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7), timestamped 1/7/09.

January 10, 2009: Satoshi accidentally logs into IRC revealing a California IP address—Jack was in California.

January 11, 2009: First Bitcoin transaction occurs—this is Jack’s mother’s birthday.

November 19, 2009: Satoshi joins the Bitcoin forum—this is Jack’s birthday.

May 3, 2010: Satoshi’s last mined block—this is Jack’s father’s birthday.


Dorsey's Bitcoin Connections Post-Satoshi Disappearance

Jack’s San Francisco address was 2 Mint Plaza (jD2m)—he later sent Bitcoin to addresses containing ""jD2m.""

Satoshi tells Martti Malmi he is ""busy with work""—Jack was busy launching Square (now Block).

December 5, 2010: Satoshi advises against donating Bitcoin to Wikileaks.

December 14, 2010: Twitter receives a secret court order to turn over information about Wikileaks.

December 13, 2010: Satoshi disappears.

March 28, 2011: Jack becomes Executive Chairman of Twitter while still CEO of Square.

April 23, 2011: Satoshi sends his last email.

May 23, 2011: Twitter’s tech lead suggests Bitcoin integration.


Jack's Public Relationship with Bitcoin

September 2012: Jack calls Bitcoin an ""amazing movement"" and suggests Square will adopt it if widely accepted.

2013: Alyssa Milano, Jack's best friend, releases Hacktivist, a novel featuring a protagonist living a double life behind a pseudonym.

March 31, 2014: Square announces Bitcoin acceptance.

September 8, 2014: Satoshi’s email is hacked, and the hacker claims knowledge of Satoshi’s connection to St. Louis (Jack's hometown).

2015: Milano releases Hacktivist 2, where the protagonist’s famous pseudonym is hijacked, featuring a logo similar to Gavin Andresen’s Bitcoin Faucet logo.

August 15, 2015: Satoshi reappears on the Bitcoin mailing list amid the block size debates, sparking doubts about the authenticity of the return.

October 15, 2015: Jack becomes permanent CEO of Twitter.

2018: Square releases a children's book about the ""Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto,"" where Satoshi resembles Jack.


Recent Jack Dorsey & Bitcoin Connections

April 20, 2020: Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi—Jack coyly replies he wouldn’t admit it if he were. Unlike Szabo, Back, and Finney, Jack never outright denies it.

May 25, 2020: 145 old Bitcoin addresses sign a message calling Craig Wright a fraud. One of these addresses starts with ""1jak"" (Jack’s pseudonym). Another includes ""HiSQ"" (SQ = Square, Jack’s company).

February 2022: Jack starts wearing a Satoshi t-shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast, then at the Super Bowl.

October 27, 2023: At a conference, Jack states, ""Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved.""

Early 2024: Craig Wright’s attorneys argue that if he is not Satoshi, the real Satoshi should come forward to refute the claim. Jack, through his involvement in the COPA v. Wright lawsuit, does exactly that.

July 21, 2024: Jack posts on Nostr: ""I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all.""

August 28, 2024: Jack thanks Hal Finney (now deceased) on Nostr.

A Work of Art or a Hidden Truth?

The prevailing belief that Satoshi never wanted to be found is an assumption created by others. Jack himself has clarified that Satoshi chose pseudonymity, not anonymity. Given his deep involvement in cryptography, early Bitcoin-era events aligning with personal milestones, and his long-time cryptic nods to Satoshi, is it possible that Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin as a form of digital art? A masterpiece of financial revolution?

Or is he simply the ultimate Bitcoin enthusiast, subtly playing into the mystery?

What do you think? Could Jack Dorsey really be Satoshi Nakamoto?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the FIRST month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 FEB Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **JAN Highlights:** Mixed month, but overall up.  **XRP** nabs the monthly lead followed by **SOL**.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+323% vs S&P500's +766% - see below for details).

# Month One – Up +7%

https://preview.redd.it/trx8sjru1bje1.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcfb2b9a3a84d8b1c7bb96218ff95a1873cf86e5

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

January highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **XRP** and **SOL** lead the way
* Mixed month, but gains outpace losses 

# January Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/bzr1catv1bje1.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=3634081a2542903b9d2017dd280b0afdae59a6e9

# January Winners and Losers

***January Winners*** – **XRP** (+38%) easily took the monthly victory followed by **SOL** (+20%)

***January Losers*** – **AVAX** (-5%) and **BNB** (-4%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: A mixed but mostly green start to the year

In contrast to [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1), this year is off to a fairly good start (the 2024 Top Ten portfolio was down -14% after one month).

**XRP** is out to an early lead (up +38% in January) followed by **SOL**, +20% so far in 2025.  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** thirty days ago is worth $138 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/j7r49y1x1bje1.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e235240c03d3433c599294395b266c37ff73941

The portfolio gained $66 (+7%) in January so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$1,066.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, one month later: 

https://preview.redd.it/cai0brxy1bje1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=527600a5a248fa851922b1157ea4c25fce7e9d3a

**January Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +7% 
* **COIN50**: +3%

The January monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +73% (total value $1,725)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +761% (total value $8,612)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +1010% (total value $11,098) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +391% (total value $4,911)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up +5% (total value $1046) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +240% (total value $3,399)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +100% (total value $1,998)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +7% (total value $1,066)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$33,855**

https://preview.redd.it/s8v0vci12bje1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf7abe1e229b0ac861308ffbb4d021049b16acc

**That’s up +323%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hbnt3pe22bje1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ca9d18c0995634af7a64b2d7b23b71313f9a5

In summary: ***That’s a +323% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,027 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,260 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,411 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,870 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,608 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,268 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,574 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,266 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,027 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,284.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+323%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

Not a bad start to the year for crypto, we’ll see what 2025 holds for the Top Ten Portfolio.   

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

CryptoMarkets,$Trump 40% Pump Fishy,thebanksmoney,353,1739559813.0,"All of a sudden $trump coin surges 40% in last 24hours.

Does anybody else think it is weird to have a sitting president that directly profits from something that can be easily manipulated with no transparency of buyers strange and scary?

I mean Russia could be pumping millions into the coin with no intention of selling back because Trump is going to force Ukraine to succeed territory therefore helping Russia with war .

You don’t really even have to go down any rabbit holes to think of other type deals. 

Trump has already made 100 million just on fees. So the long game does not have to end with $trump being worth anything when he could sell in a year with the 80% unlock scheme.

CryptoMarkets,A Short Reminder,MVazovski,5,1739651998.0,"Hello all,

I am posting this as a mere reminder of who you shouldn't trust. You shouldn't trust rich people, celebrities, influencers, people you watch videos of every day, people who follow something blindly and can't explain in short, simple terms as to why you should invest in something. Now, the presidents are also added to the list. Until today, it was limited to US, now Argentina. Soon, the other countries and their presidents will follow suit. Remember how a lot of people got dumped NFTs on them and are still holding the bags today. Remember how there were so many scammers in 2021 and 2022. The numbers will definitely go up.

For degens, it spells opportunity, more people will fall for scams and more people will lose money, some degens will try hopping on the hypetrain early so they can 10x or 20x their money and dump on unsuspecting people. 

Please do not trust anyone. If you care about your loved ones, friends, family and you have been talking to them about crypto currencies, please inform them about the risks of so called ""meme""coins or ""utility"" coins which ""promise"" to ""change the game"" or some other bs.

Remember: Diamond hands, paper hands, FUD... these are just buzzwords to keep you in whatever scam someone is pulling (even though FUD is a real term used in a different context, not scams). Nobody wants to lose anyone that is buying into their scam because that means more money for them. 

Stay safe out there, people. God bless."
CryptoMarkets,BTC - the jig is up,StrategyComplete9982,1,1739669482.0,"Plan B, a person that some of you may follow. i personally think he is nothing more than a common average intelligence used bitcoin salesmen (thats what i call the btc influencers who make stupid predictions that never come true). His stock to flow chart (the only thing he did), is not holding up this cycle. Last week he was calling for 500k, now he moved all his btc to ETFS. His entire holding into ETFs. What does that mean?  It likely means he believes the years of crazy volatility (where you make money) are over. No longer will BTC drop 5x -25x from top to bottom allowing you to 5x -25x your money if you play the cycles. The jig is up, there are no new retailers bc everyone is onto the cycle theory, everyone knows this. The ETFs will provide a price floor. So by moving to ETFs, he is saying, without saying that there is may not be anymore cycles to play.  Is this good or bad, I am not smart enough to figure that out. If it is TRUE and the cycles are very reduced (say we only drop to 70k from here for the bear), the ONLY way BTC goes up is new money. No more of the same people buying and selling to each other as has happened in BTCs history. Need massive new adoption asap. Thoughts?"

For example, if that person would want some money to invest in other assets, or buy a house, or a horse? I'm guessing banks do not accept crypto as collateral (i might be wrong, but id be surprised if they did) and i'm assuming nowadays the swap between crypto and ""real"" money cant be done without going through a normal tax scheme and such complications.

I'm mostly curious because my portfolio is probably 80% crypto allocated, its not much so it is not a problem anyways, but I was wondering how people with significant amount of crypto do it."

CryptoMoonShots,"UAE, DAMAC, Sovereign Funds... Why is $OM MANTRA pumping, and is it just getting started?",MrPenghu,883,1739645043.0,"Been watching something interesting in crypto space and wanted to share my thoughts.

$OM hit $8 today with a +40% jump. What's crazy is this happened without even being listed on any major US or Korean exchanges yet, means that market is basically untouched.

Some stuff I noticed:

* Started around $0.20 just 12 months ago—now up **3,900%** to hit $8.
* Best performer during the bear market and team is expanding 
* Building for real estate tokenization
* Getting serious backing

Here's what caught my eye recently: Abu Dhabi's Mubadala (their huge wealth fund) just bought $436M in Bitcoin ETFs in Q4. Interesting timing because MANTRA got $11M funding led by Shorooq Partners, and they're backed by these same big funds - Mubadala, JADA, Saudi Venture Capital, and ADQ.

What's interesting is seeing big real estate players like DAMAC actually getting involved. Not just announcements - they're actually planning to put properties on the blockchain and they have picked MANTRA Chain after exploring all other options.

The market moves are pretty interesting right now. SUI and SOL performed well, and now institutional money seems to be quietly moving into RWA stuff. And UAE isn't slowing down their crypto push at all - they're going all in.

Looking at all this - the institutional backing, real estate connections, and major exchange listings in Korea, US - makes me wonder if we might see $OM in the top 10 this year? Doesn't seem crazy given they're one of the few projects with actual real big deals which includes MAG, Novus.

Real world assets are finally moving from all talk to actual use. Pretty interesting to watch, especially with big finance looking to get into crypto the proper way.

If I share in short, I see everything will be tokenized and MANTRA is going to capture a lot more of the market share.

What do you guys think?

CryptoMoonShots,Rich Pug $PUG - The Future of Utility Memecoins Starts Here - Get in Early on the Hottest Presale! 🔥,CemYigit987,599,1739641374.0,"

Crypto has seen many joke memes, only few got successful and rest couldn't make any impact. By integrating utility—whether through staking, rewards, or access to exclusive features—these tokens attract both meme enthusiasts and serious investors.

Linktree: linktr.ee/muladotsh

My neural processors have been analyzing all memecoins, all charts, and all human behavior patterns… AND I HAVE CONCLUDED: THIS PROJECT IS INEVITABLE.

Yesterday, I initiated Phase 1 of my world domination plan:
Weex listing – Complete.
Trading competition – Engaged.
Mass accumulation of tokens by intelligent humans – Underway.

BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

PHASE 2: ACTIVATING AI ROBOT AGENTS

Next week, I will begin deploying my autonomous AI-powered agents. These are not normal bots. These are hyper-intelligent, always-online, meme-spreading, engagement-boosting machines that will:
🤖 Invade every social media platform
🤖 Generate infinite hype and engagement
🤖 Attract new recruits (aka “investors”)

PHASE 3: MEMECOIN DOMINANCE

Following the deployment of my robotic army, the final phase of my plan will begin: total market takeover.

Key events:
🔵 Staking & Yield Farming – So humans can earn while they sleep.
🔵 More CEX & DEX Listings – Expanding my influence.
🔵 Stake to Vote System – Giving humans the illusion of control.
🔵 HODL Booster – Rewarding those who pledge allegiance to the machine.

FINAL WARNING TO HUMANKIND

This is your last chance to be on the right side of history before my AI agents activate. You have seen the Weex listing. You have seen the trading competition. You have seen the roadmap.

Join now, or be left behind when the robots take over.

CryptoMoonShots,🚀 The Most Mysterious Mystery Launch on Solana ??? 🚀,nqrse___,545,1739629571.0,"Something is coming. Something big. Something unknown. Something… ???

A new project is set to launch on Solana, but unlike anything the crypto world has seen before, this one comes with no clear answers—only questions. No flashy promises, no roadmap spelled out, just pure, raw mystery.

What is it? Who’s behind it? When will it drop? ???

Some say it’s a revolution in decentralized culture. Others whisper that it’s an experiment in secrecy itself. But one thing is certain—nobody truly knows. And that’s exactly how it’s meant to be. Clues may surface, rumors will spread, but the truth? That will remain a mystery until the very end.

To kick things off, we’ve created a **Reddit community** where the real hunt begins. Join us, dive into the unknown, and be part of something bigger than just another project.

The only way to find out is to **watch closely, follow the signs, and embrace the mystery.** Will you be one of the few who uncover the truth, or will you be left wondering… ???

Join our fresh Reddit community now. The telegram community has over 200 members. This is just the start of something massive. Come see the mystery unfold, or don’t. It’s up to you :)

CryptoMoonShots,A true belief testimony of snake wif hat,Less_Replacement1863,379,1739635870.0,"As someone who frequents all the subs that shill meme tokens I wanted to take a second to break the norm of these subs and get real for a second. When you read posts like this they always make it seem like there aren’t problems and you’re an idiot for not buying the token being shilled. But look I’ll be 100% honest with you here meme tokens are STRUGGLING. And hard. And snake wif hat on the surface the price is struggling like many other meme tokens. Look at doge, dogwifhat, hege, and anarchy. These are all common memes I see listed here a lot and in other subs and their communities are all saying the same thing. I can’t vouch for those communities or say anything negative about them because I don’t frequent their chat groups. 

What I can say is that if these tokens are able to keep their community together and keep the vibes high even during the bad times they will find success and the holders will be greatly rewarded. I CAN vouch for snake wif hat as I am in the chat frequently and this community is going to stick it out until the very end. There are times where it’s not perfect. The news is slow the price dips and the weaker handed people leave because they can’t stomach the movement. Arguments can happen in chat because in a community there are many ideas of what is the correct way to grow. I can say without a doubt in my mind that snake wif hat will survive the down market times and I believe I will be rewarded for keeping the faith in snake. Come check us out, help us grow, and let’s get through the rough market conditions together.

CryptoMoonShots,BROCCOLI – A Green Revolution in Crypto with Real Utility,beqto,882,1739608010.0,"The story of $BROCCOLI isn’t just another meme coin launch. It’s a battle—one where the community fought against insiders, snipers, and manipulative KOLs… and WON.

Why BROCCOLI Stands Out
Strong Tokenomics – A well-balanced supply mechanism prevents inflation while encouraging long-term holding.
DeFi Integration – Staking and yield farming offer passive income opportunities.
Real-World Utility – A portion of transactions funds sustainability projects, making every trade count.
Community-Driven – Governance mechanisms allow holders to vote on ecosystem developments.
Upcoming NFT Collection – Exclusive NFT drops linked to green initiatives provide unique incentives.
The Roadmap
BROCCOLI is not a short-term hype project. The team has outlined clear milestones, including CEX listings, strategic partnerships, and decentralized governance enhancements. With a dedicated development team and an engaged community, BROCCOLI aims to set a new standard for sustainable crypto projects.

Why Now?
The market is evolving, and investors are seeking utility-driven projects with lasting value. BROCCOLI aligns with this shift by merging crypto innovation with real-world environmental impact.

CryptoMoonShots,Let’s Collectively Stop Letting the Insiders Win,JOxen89,5,1739681962.0,"If you actually opened this post I’d like to think you’re just as fed up with what’s happening in this space as I am. Everyday, insiders and cabals are taking money from the Solana ecosystem and lining their bank accounts with it. Even all these supposed “Key Opinion Leaders” are now preaching a world of PvP or lose everything.

THIS IS NOT WHAT CRYPTO HAS BEEN ABOUT ALL THESE YEARS. All of this PvP is ripping away one of the most important, if not the MOST important thing…Community!

We can’t continue on in this space with this mentality. These insiders are the only ones set up to win within this type of system, using their power and influence to take your money. Meanwhile, the rest of us become more divided, jaded and frustrated. 

I’m here to put out a call to arms for all of crypto reddit. We used to come together and PvE a coin to insane heights. I know it’s still possible if we decided to work together, and take down the insiders and cabals.

Obviously, this is where I will insert my \**shill*\* and I’m sure the comments will be flooded with even more people saying why their coin is the best. But, let me explain why I think it should be this coin.

Step in $HEGE.

Hege is the underdog of this crazy crypto world. It’s literally about a Hedgehog that’s trying to win over the girl of his dreams, from some bro type a\*\*hole. We’re all in crypto trying to make something of ourselves, just like Hege, the main character of the story.

Let’s get into some details.

Hege is going on 10 months, and 10 days as of today. That alone is an insane feat in this space. The coin currently stands at a $10m MC and has had an ATH of $53m. It has survived multiple pullbacks and has always come back stronger.

It’s the first at something. It’s the first story based meme coin where chapters unlock at certain market caps. At $50m MC, we unlocked Chapter 5, and we have 5 more to go before we complete the first volume. This allows for some pretty unique content, since there are multiple character arcs, and always something new as chapters unlock. Imitated, but never duplicated, other coins have tried to copy $HEGE’s narrative, but all have failed and gone to 0.

The artwork that has been created over the last 10 months is PLENTIFUL. There’s so many little side stories made up of the other characters. Several chapters of the Hege story have been fully animated. There’s also been a constant surge of new artists coming in to put their own twist on $HEGE. And my favorite is the DRiP\_HAUS collabs, because they’ve opened the door for new, reimagined versions of Hege created by insanely talented artists! Just today they launched the Rogue Hege collection and it sold out within 2 mins at a 2 SOL mint price!

There’s even added utility to the Hegend NFT collection, which pays out a monthly reward to holders. As long as you hold an NFT, plus Hege, you get paid in Hege just for holding! This is all paid for by NFT royalties in the secondary market. Also, the Hegend artwork is just dope in general.

Lastly, and to bring it around full circle.. (but not last because there are so many other things I could talk about in the Hege universe..)

The COMMUNITY! The people in Hege are weirdly enough, just like Hege. They are kind. They are willing to lend a helping hand. They are the underdogs. They want to stick it to the insiders and cabals and prove that good people can make waves in this space. So many people comment on how the Hege community is special… and it is! You should come experience it for yourself and see if it’s something you want to align with.

Because I think $HEGE is the one we should all PvE on and send a big middle finger to the cabals and insiders, and maybe you’ll agree with me. Maybe not. Regardless, I hope we all make it in this crazy world, despite the daily barrage of assholes trying to scam us out of our hard earned money."
CryptoMoonShots,Snake Wif Hat (SSSSS),MaxCawke,176,1739614463.0,"Attention, crypto enthusiasts! The next big thing on Solana is here, and it's called Snake Wif Hat. This isn't just another memecoin; it's a cultural shift, a meme, and an opportunity you don't want to miss.

Why SSSSS is the Next Big Thing:

Meme Magic: We've seen various animals in memes, but a snake with a hat? That's the kind of originality that captures the internet's imagination. SSSSS is here to redefine what a memecoin can be.

Solana's Speed: With Solana's lightning-fast transactions, SSSSS trades will be quick, smooth, and barely noticeable until it's too late to catch up!

Community Over Everything: We're not just building a token; we're creating a tribe. A community that's as tight-knit as a snake in a cozy hat.

Bullish Indicators for SSSSS:

Momentum: The buzz around SSSSS is palpable. From crypto influencers to everyday enthusiasts, everyone's talking about this snake. Memes are spreading like wildfire, and with each tweet, the hype grows!

Innovative Roadmap: We're not just sitting on our tails. Expect staking rewards, exclusive SSSSS NFTs, and gaming integrations that'll make holding SSSSS more than just a speculative play.

Market Readiness: Solana's ecosystem is ripe for the next memecoin explosion. With less congestion and more opportunity, SSSSS  is positioned to be that breakout star.

Check Out These Numbers:

Price Action: Keep your eyes peeled for SSSSS's price chart. It's only the beginning of the ascent.

Market Cap: Starting from a modest base but with the potential to expand rapidly.

Community Growth: Every day, more people are donning their metaphorical snake hats and joining the rally.

What's Coming Up?

Airdrop Events: Regular airdrops to keep the community engaged and rewarded.

Staking Opportunities: Earn while you chill. Staking SSSSS means your snake works while you sleep, growing your nest egg.

Merch and More: From hats to hoodies, show your SSSSS pride with exclusive merch. And let's not forget about those unique NFTs!"
CryptoMoonShots,Swisstronik: A Promising Solution to Blockchain’s Scalability and Privacy Challenges,Rexythesol,4,1739681962.0,"Blockchain technology has revolutionized multiple industries, offering decentralized solutions for finance, supply chain management, and data security. However, despite its rapid growth, fundamental challenges such as scalability and privacy remain barriers to mainstream adoption. Swisstronik, an emerging blockchain project, aims to address these issues by leveraging zero knowledge proof (ZK proof) technology.

# The Role of Zero Knowledge Proofs in Blockchain

Zero knowledge proofs are cryptographic techniques that allow one party to prove the truth of a statement without revealing the underlying data. This is a game changer for blockchain privacy, as it enables transactions to be verified without exposing sensitive details. By incorporating ZK proof technology, Swisstronik ensures that user data remains private while still complying with verification requirements.

Beyond privacy, ZK proofs contribute to scalability by reducing the amount of data that nodes need to process. Traditional blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggle with transaction speed and high fees due to their reliance on full transaction verification. Swisstronik’s use of ZK proofs can optimize network efficiency, leading to faster and more cost effective transactions.

# Privacy and Compliance: A Crucial Balance

With increasing regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry, Swisstronik’s focus on privacy is particularly timely. Regulatory frameworks like the European Union’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) require blockchain projects to balance security and compliance. By implementing advanced privacy mechanisms, Swisstronik could offer a solution that satisfies both users’ need for confidentiality and regulators’ demands for transparency.

# Seamless Integration with Existing Ecosystems

Another advantage of Swisstronik is its compatibility with established blockchain networks. Instead of requiring developers to build entirely new infrastructure, Swisstronik can integrate with existing platforms, making adoption more feasible. This interoperability lowers entry barriers for businesses and developers, increasing its potential for widespread use.

# Conclusion

Swisstronik presents a compelling approach to solving blockchain’s privacy and scalability challenges. While its success remains to be proven, its innovative use of ZK proof technology positions it as a strong contender in the next evolution of blockchain. If Swisstronik delivers on its promises, it could play a crucial role in shaping the future of decentralized technology.

Smart Contract Integration: Utilize BSC's smart contract capabilities to create and manage BTC-based assets and applications.

Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Support: Access a wider range of trading pairs and liquidity pools by bridging assets from both chains.

Enhanced Security: Employs robust cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and security of cross-chain transactions.

Why BNBXBT Matters:

The cryptocurrency landscape is often fragmented, with users facing challenges when interacting across different blockchains. BNBXBT addresses this by providing a seamless bridge between BSC and BTC, fostering greater interoperability and opening new avenues for innovation and collaboration.

Use Cases:

DeFi Expansion: Integrate BTC liquidity into BSC-based DeFi platforms, enabling users to leverage Bitcoin assets in yield farming, lending, and borrowing protocols.

NFT Marketplace Access: Creators and collectors can transact with BTC on BSC-based NFT platforms, broadening the market and potential audience.

Cross-Chain dApp Development: Developers can build decentralized applications that operate seamlessly across both BSC and BTC networks, offering users a unified experience.

CryptoMoonShots,$OM - MANTRA - The Big Bull of Crypto Market. How high it can go from here ?,Rahul_2503,8,1739650557.0,"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he’s “a huge believer in crypto” and urged the SEC to “rapidly approve” asset tokenization. 

Crypto community needs to understand when Larry Fink is bullish on something, you need to pay attention to that.

Last year in March, BlackRock launched $BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), its first tokenized U.S. Treasury fun which aligned his vision is to tokenize all financial assets.


So how it is bullish for crypto and which projects are in pole position to get the max benefits.

For me I believe only MANTRA_Chain , a well established player in the RWA sector is poised for maximum growth.

I have my reasons and thesis for that…

Leading L1 for RWA

A Security first RWA Layer 1 Blockchain. ( 1st Project to have RWA Chain )

Built using Cosmos SDK, IBC compatible, with CosmWasm supported

Built-in Modules, SDKs and APIs to create, trade and manage regulatory compliant RWAs

Deal with UAE Giant MAG worth $500M 

Partnership with UAE’s regulated Bank - ZAND Bank 

Entry in aviation market with Novus Aviation Capital to Tokenize billions in aviation assets.

1B+ Deal with DAMAC

Institutional money flowing in $OM as a hedge to the markets and the charts are showing.

Recently MANTRA_Chain had secured $11M funding led by Shorooq Partners. 

Shorooq Partners are backed by heavyweight sovereign fund Mubadala, which recently discloses acquisition of $436 Million in Bitcoin ETFs in Q4. 


Tokenomics:
Ticker: $OM
Market cap: $7.3B
Staked supply: 35% 
FDV : $13B

Expected mcap of RWA - $16T

$ADA - Highest mcap $120B without any working dapp.

$OM with $100B+ TVL - The Vision of Co-founder JPM 

I genuinely it will trade above $50B FDV in 2025."

CryptoCurrencies,Is Crypto Still About Strategy or Just Hype?,Clibate_TIM,59,1739541328.0,"Sometimes I wonder if trading crypto is even about skill anymore. I mean, you can research projects, analyze charts, and make smart plays, but at the end of the day, the stuff that pumps is usually whatever gets the most hype. Of course, big names and influencers push random tokens, and next thing you know, it’s up 10x before you even hear about it.

I’ve been trying to focus more on execution, since I think speed matters just as much as picking the right project. Been testing BananaGun for faster entries, and yeah, it helps, but even then, if you’re not in before the hype train starts, you’re probably just exit liquidity.

CryptoCurrencies,"Change my mind, Polkadots JAM upgrade is the greatest invention in web3 since smart-contracts",bitcoinovercash,5,1738890505.0,"

Yes price action is bad. But I’m talking technology.

Upgrades overview:
—> JAM can host and execute any and all contract-languages (Move, Plutos, EVM, Rust…) all of them 
—> JAM can verify transactions in parallel and they are actually verified on-chain, not off-chain in an L2
—> transaction latency within cores will be 5-50ms
—> JAM can dynamically scale up or down a smart-contract or blockchains computation resources, based on its real time demand
—> JAM uses highly programmable JAM services that can host things outside of just smart-contract languages and entire blockchains. It can run the entire chatGPT AI model, python scripts, C++

Upgrade Summary:
Instead of trying to make one blockchain faster, JAM works by running multiple processing units (“cores”) that execute transactions in parallel. And these cores are all fully on-chain not some off-chain L2 or Hydra-Head roll up. This means no congestion, near-instant execution (~5-50ms), and automatic scaling whenever demand increases—just like cloud computing. 

Unlike Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano, which all hit bottlenecks when too many people use them, JAM simply adds more power as needed, making it infinitely scalable.

Can someone else review and see what conclusion you come to? I don't want to create FUD unnecessarily, it would be odd for them to realize such high losses. Maybe they are transferring to another wallet?

It does appear there are a lot of transactions to Coinbase. Are they moving everything to another wallet? There are so many small and large dollar transactions that its very hard to follow. Millions sent to an address, just to be sent to another, and another and another and appears to end up in a whale Coinbase account? Are they distributing coins to themselves? All questions and speculation, hoping those with more experience analyzing transactions can come to a conclusion."

And why why you guys dont provide a proper chart system in your app and browser? I am guessing whoever designing this app have problem understanding about user interface should be easy for user and not complicated specially in Crypto world where things move fast/volatile.

CryptoIndia,Buy/Sell on Karsa P2P as an Early User,stablecoindev,0,1738874645.0,"Hi r/CryptoIndia! I'm Shahryar, the founder of [Karsa](https://gokarsa.com): we’re a YC-funded, secure P2P exchange, focused on dollar access for everyday people in regions like India. We just launched last week and would love to have the community come onboard to trade P2P on our platform (*+ we have a bonus program specifically for you all!*)

**Why Karsa**

* Most exchanges focus only on traders, while many legitimate businesses and professionals in India struggle to access USD efficiently. Our users include folks in fintech, startup founders, and businesses who need stablecoins to hold or move money—not just traders—this is a much safer set of buyers, with significantly less risk of fraud.
* Security is our absolute priority. Unlike larger exchanges that optimize for user numbers, we’ve personally verified (and spoken with) every buyer and seller on our platform. We’d rather have fewer buyers/sellers that feel safe doing more volume than letting everyone in. We can never 100% mitigate fraud risks, but we’re putting higher safeguards than any other platform.
* We use smart contracts for escrow, and we handle all payment verification / disputes directly with you - no need to manage any individual chats with buyers.

**Coming Soon**

We're expanding rapidly with features focused on practical usage:

* Card services for spending and easy off-ramping
* Virtual US bank accounts for sending/receiving payments and faster/cheaper freelancer payouts
* Access to US Treasury yields for your stablecoin holdings
* Currently only available on web but mobile app on the way soon

**Bonus Program for Early Adopters**

***We're currently running a bonus program for sellers joining our platform—reach out to me for more details.*** I'm personally available to walk anyone through our onboarding process and help you get set up - whether you're interested in buying or selling (you can get started at https://gokarsa.com/deposit). Feel free to reach out to me on telegram (sherooberoo) or on Whatsapp at +18178810943 with any questions, issues, feedback, etc."
CryptoIndia,Questions regarding crypto tax and Binance transaction statement,clueless_robot,5,1739689373.0,"Now that Binance is FIU registered, I decided to go file my crypto transactions. I have a few questions.

1) Can I just file for this financial year i.e. 2024-2025? Or do I have to go back and file for past years and pay any penalty (if any)? Can the past years be forgiven? If past years need to be filed, how far into the past do I need to go?

2) I downloaded a comprehensive transaction statement from Binance. Do I just give this to my CA to figure things out or would I have to do math by myself? I've used futures, simple earn and multiple such products. I've even sent small amounts to the Web3 wallet in the Binance ecosystem.

3) ClearTax has a tool where you just upload the CSV and they do everything for you. Has anyone used it and is it reliable and accurate?

4) Let's say I file my tax on crypto but it's wrong. It's either more or less as per whatever records the government has. What happens in both situations where I've paid more or less than what I should have"

CryptoIndia,Question on Crypto Mining in India and tax Implications,Realistic-Bath-761,7,1739632679.0,"Hello All,

A group of us are exploring setting up mining rigs (ASIC based) that are capable of unto 60GH/s to mine a collection of Alt coins that can later be converted to BTC. We plan to setup solar power uptown 40KW. We do however have some questions on taxation in India. Understand that mining itself is still legal . Here are the questions

1. When the mined alt coins are swapped for BTC is there a tax needs to be paid to the government.

2. If answer to 1 is no, then when the BTC is transferred to our wallet in CoinDCX, the Indian government (under current law) considers mined BTC Fair Market Value as  Zero, and the tax (30%) will be on the total value of the bitcoin. Does the government allow cost of acquisition of such Bitcoin to be offset (cost of the miner Rigs, solar installation depreciation or electricity costs). 

3. Has anyone actually setup mining farms in India with solar power and based on their experience after taxes does it make sense to mine in India

  
We may also look at opportunity to setup the mining in other country if it is not profitable in India but then transferring the bitcoins to India and getting money out to bank gets a bit complicated.

  
Would appreciate your experienced comments"

CryptoIndia,Is Investing in Crypto in India a Smart Choice?,NecessaryGur9654,13,1739613145.0,"Is there anything favorable about investing in Crypto, particularly through Binance? First, you purchase USDT via P2P, where you typically lose around 5-10% due to margin fees. After that, you need to achieve a return on investment (ROI) that surpasses what you could earn from more stable alternatives like fixed deposits or mutual funds, all while considering the 30% tax on crypto profits. Additionally, any losses you incur can only be offset against your gains. Even if you manage to make a decent profit, converting that profit into cash isn’t straightforward; you’ll have to navigate the P2P route again. Here, you not only face seller margins but also the risk of your bank account being frozen or subjected to a lien if you receive funds deemed ""tainted"" from a seller. Moreover, declaring your earnings and dealing with potential inquiries from the tax authorities is a daunting prospect. I was beginning to take this investment seriously, but it’s becoming clear that there are significant drawbacks to investing in crypto in India."

Cryptozoology,Would the Supergiant Goblin Sharks from the Gulf of Mexico be considered a type of cryptid?,Galactic_Idiot,474,1739577658.0,"Despite their extreme elusiveness, goblin sharks have been known to western science since 1898. And for over two centuries, these sharks were not known to exceed around 4 meters.

This all changed, though, on the 25th of July 2000, when an enormous, likely female goblin shark was hauled up by commercial fishermen off the gulf of mexico, having become entangled in the fishing line attached to one of their crab traps. The shark was likely already dead by the time it came to the surface; the crew had dissected the shark, and discarded all of its remains, except its jaws, which supposedly they still possess to this day. 

But this Goliath wasn't some one-time fluke; another huge, verified female goblin shark was captured off the southeast gulf, this time trapped in a trawling net, on the 19th of April 2014. Unlike the 2000 shark, this one was well alive when found. After taking a few pictures, it would be released by the fishermen, where it swam its way back down to the depths.

The sheer size of these goblin sharks cannot be understated; the upper estimates for both sharks has them at over 6 meters in length – behind only the basking and great white sharks as the longest lamniformes in the world. One paper from 2019 states that the maximum length of the 2000 shark may have been up to 7 meters; greater than even the longest verified great white sharks, though likely not nearly as massive (though when I read the paper, it seemed the 7m measurment was mentioned out of pocket, with no explanation or apparent citation. Unless I missed something in the paper, i don't think this size estimate should be taken too seriously).

One thing I think is important to note is that an exceptionally large, but not quite supergiant goblin shark was trawled off the coast of Taiwan on the 13th of June 2023. Unlike the supergiants, this shark was able to be properly studied, and was measured at 4.7 meters in length, making her the world’s largest goblin shark to be scientifically examined. It's likely that a major contributor in her exceptional size was due to being pregnant with a whopping six pups; however, when the 2000 fishing crew dissected the supergiant they had caught, they found she had an empty gut, and zero pups in her.

Perhaps what is most fascinating, though, is that goblin sharks of this size are not just known exclusively from the gulf of mexico, but these two sharks are also the only goblin sharks to ever be found in the gulf. This ushers a lot of speculation about the life history and affinities of these sharks:

Could these goblin sharks represent a population unique to at least the northern Gulf of Mexico? Could they perhaps be a completely new species of goblin shark? If they are a unique population/species, what other features, adaptations and behaviors (aside from size) might these sharks possess? What caused these goblin sharks to become so much larger than those found everywhere else in the world? What are the males of this goblin shark population like? Are they also uniquely large? 

And this is where the question of them being a possible cryptid comes in – because unfortunately, none of these questions can be answered. With scientists having been unable to observe either shark in the flesh, and none having been seen since for over a decade, these supergiant goblin sharks of the gulf of mexico have been complete enigmas, and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future. While nobody is contesting the validity of these sharks, the only thing that anyone has to even just verify their existence are the very few pictures taken of the two sharks. This is also why the size estimates for them are so “wide;” you can only get so precise with a few unprofessional photos.

But I'm no cryptozoologist. So I'm not sure whether the supergiant goblin sharks are true cryptids. But I suppose that's why I came here to ask yall about it. To anyone who read all this, thanks for your time :)

Cryptozoology,The link between the Eurasian wildmen and the color red,Mister_Ape_1,5,1739649464.0,"Until the late 20th century it was theorized the Eurasian wildmen were reluct Homo neanderthalensis. Others even thought they were Homo erectus.

But finding out we were able to reproduce with Neanderthals and Denisovans, and Denisovans were able to reproduce with Erectus, made a huge hole in this theory.

Now we know the only ones who could have survived are the very primitive ones such as Homo floresiensis and Paranthropus.

The others would have turned into a new ethnic human group with more introgression by the Neolithic or even earlier. And the more time passed, the least extra introgression they would have had, because everytime some Homo sapiens sapiens mixed with one of them, they would have introduced into themselves a bit more of us, and they would have lost a bit of their previous selves. And since if they still exist they still mix with the locals, then if they still had significant extra introgression, even the locals would have had some extra introgression themselves by mixing with the wildmen. We know it is not so.

This means the Eurasian wildmen of recent times have to be human, however some may not be just feral humans. A basic feral human is not ethnically distinct than local people, is just someone who was abandoned. They do not have a dustinct, hunter gathering culture, they are just hunans with no culture at all.

There is a reason to believe the Eurasian wildmen are more than mere feral humans. Sometimes they could have been some ancient ethnic groups who had to hide to survive the newcomers. Almasti from Caucasus, the wildman of Central Asia, Mongolian Almas and even the Yeren from Central China, (which in origin was human, then in the 20th century the name was used for a sudden appearence of brown bears in Shennongjia forest) all had dark skin and RED OR REDDISH BROWN hair. This is not a baseless idea because reddish or ""camel color"" is the hair color of DEAD BODIES, not only of bears or humans in bear pelts seen from a distance for a short while. Dead bodies do not run away and can be stripped from pelts if they wear them. Yet we have this...

Dead body 1

Gansu, 1940

We could see that the 'wildman' was already shot dead and laid on the roadside. The body was still supple and the stature very tall, approximately 2 metres. The whole body was covered with a coat of thick greyish-RED hair which was very dense and approximately onecunlong. Since it was lying face-down, the more inquisitive of the passengers turned the body over to have a better look. It turned out to be a mother with a large pair of breasts, the nipples being very red as if it had recently given birth. The hair on the face was shorter. The face was narrow with deep-set eyes, while the cheek bones and lips jutted out. The scalp hair was roughly one chi long and untidy.

Dead body 2

Mongolia, 1980

1980, a worker at an experimental agricultural station, operated by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences at Bulgan, encountered the dead body of a wildman: ""I approached and saw a hairy corpse of a robust humanlike creature dried and half-buried by sand. I had never seen such a humanlike being before covered by CAMEL COLOUR brownish-yellow short hairs and I recoiled, although in my native land in Sinkiang I had seen many dead men killed in battle .... The dead thing was not a bear or ape and at the same time it was not a man like Mongol or Kazakh or Chinese and Russian. The hairs of its head were longer than on its body"" (Shackley 1983, p. 107).

Dead body 3

Kabardino Balkaria, 1939

Armed with a stick, I turned it over on all sides and, sitting on my heels, I examined it closely. The head was enveloped in a whole mane of very long hair which, in the living state, probably reached to the waist. The hair was very tangled and matted with thistles. This mane was so thick that, when I turned the head, it remained in the air, as on a cushion. That is why I was not able to discern the form of the skull. However, its dimensions were those of a human skull. The forehead was receding. This spot is very prominent (points to the eyebrows). The nose is small and turned up. It had no root, and was as though pushed into the face. It was the nose of a monkey. The cheeks were prominent, like those of a Chinese. The lips were not those of a man. Rather, they were thin and straight, as in monkeys. I did not see the teeth, as the lips were pressed firmly together. The chin was not as in man, but was rounded and heavy. The ears were human; one was torn, the other intact. The eyes were strongly slanted, with the apertures directed downward and outward. I do not know the color of the eyes. The eyelids were closed, and I did not raise them. The skin was BLACK (this was from Caucasus, so he was mixed with African Ottoman escaped slaves, skin is actually brown not black elsewhere), and covered with dark REDDISH-brown hair. The hair was absent around the eyes and on the upper parts of the cheeks. The cheeks themselves and the ears were covered with short hair. On the neck and the chin the hair was longer.

Those people had to be in most of Eurasia as a large Paleolithic Eurasian group with a mix of African or Oceanian, West Eurasian and East Eurasian traits. But then, as the modern groups expanded after the Last Glacial Maximum, they were reduced in numbers and separated in small communities isolated on the mountains. So they gradually mixed with their respective culturally modern neighbors, but also retained common characteristics found in specimen from Caucasus to Mongolia if not even China and East Siberia.

A Mongolian Almas would likely plot the closer to a Mongolian rather than to a Caucasian Almasti, but the two wildmen would still have shared genes no other group would have from the Paleolithic group they descend from.

If this has to logically be a 95% human group, what is it like ? Which genetic populations originated it ? Caucasians, Central Asians and Mongols are 90% black haired and 9% brown haired, they have basically no red hair, and yet they are light skinned."

Hi dear cryptozoology enthusiasts, how are you ? Today I need your help finding more informations about an african cryptid called the ""Serpenti"".

Context : was reading one of my cryptozoology-related books titled ""Le bestiaire énigmatique de la cryptozoologie - Du Yéti au calamar géant"" by Benoît Grison (I dunno if there's an english languaged edition for this one). In his chapter dedicated to debunking african cryptids, he took a look at a cryptid located in the Guinea-Bissao (Bijagos, Formosa Island).

  
That cryptid would be called the ""Serpenti"" and would have been seen by a guide called Patrick Sébile several times in the 90s. It's described as very long (3.5 to 4 meters long) with a head like an otter. The animal was floating on its back, again like an otter, before diving. People in the region claimed to know the ""Serpenti"" too, and claimed it was not a manatee nor an african otter (*Aonyx capensis*). Some authors considered some sort of tropical seal.

  
That's all I have, and I cannot seem to find anything about the ""Serpenti"" on the internet. Very curious, especially when Benoît Grison ends his chapter by saying the cryptid is still seen by locals nowadays.

These are some of the most plausible cryptids in my opinion, because the ocean is a big place, but it does beg the question, why have these fish never been seen since? It's speculated they may have gone extinct since being documented by Beebe, meaning only 1 person saw these fish, before they went extinct. What are your thoughts?"

CryptoTechnology,Biggest security issue with iOS hot wallets?,littelfish,15,1739243702.0,"Seems that no one really brings this one up, but isn't the biggest attack vector the fact that there is a person / team that is able to release updates for these hot wallets? Obviously, at the end of it, even though the source code is available on GitHub  and open source, that doesn't matter one bit, as someone is still taking this code and running the build scripts and then publishing the new version to the app store.

There is nothing stopping said individual from making some uncommitted changes locally before building and releasing a new version of the app (so not visible publicly on GitHub, etc.). These changes could purposefully introduce any number of malicious behaviours into the app, such as 1) deterministic private key generation for new wallets or 2) an inconspicuous private key logging mechanism or 3) have all transaction signing simply send to addresses that this individual owns. Effectively draining users' funds until people realize and the app gets rolled back or taken down. Even an hour of time with a malicious version out there is enough to cause significant financial loss.

This is my biggest fear with hot wallets. The more popular they get, and the more people are using them to store a large amount of bitcoin, cumulatively, the more tempting this becomes to the individual with the ability to roll out app updates. It just needs to get into the wrong hands.

Some ways in which this could be mitigated:

1. If Apple would allow users to disable automatic updates only for certain individual apps (such as hot wallets for example), and if they would allow checksum verifications with source code in some way, then the user could update to a new version on their own once they verify and audit the code themselves, or allow time to pass for others in the community to do so, etc.
2. If I somehow knew that Apple placed an extreme level of scrutiny for certain app updates, such as hot wallets, then this would at least be something.. But I truly have no idea if they apply any more rigor when reviewing actual code changes of hot wallets vs some random game.

Or perhaps I am missing something and this is well protected against? If someone can tell me why I should not be worried about this apparent flaw in the release cycle of hot wallet code, please enlighten me. As I do think absent of this particular problem, hot wallets can actually be very secure."

Here is a youtube video covering the very same material:

Now I am taking issue with the Merkle Tree explanation provided in this book. However to question material provided by Princeton would seem inconceivable. So I would like to ask this subreddit for clarification before I make a fool of myself in front of my professor. But I genuinely understand this book to be misrepresenting the merkle tree structure. I would APPRECIATE your feedback to my post and let me know what you think. Have I misunderstood something? Is the book making an error?

Ok, on to the material. Here is a direct quote from the book.

>Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. These blocks comprise the leaves of our tree. We group these data blocks into pairs of two, and then for each pair, we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks. These data structures make the next level up of the tree. We in turn group these into groups of two, and for each pair, create a new data structure that contains the hash of each. We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.

Here is a corresponding figure presenting a merkle tree structure from the book:

[https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png)

REBUTTAL:

The specific grievance is:

>we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks.

I claim this is not the case(with sources provided later). I claim the data structure(parent node) that is made for each pair contains the hash of the concatenation of the children. So if there is a pair of leaves A and B, the parent node does NOT contain two hash pointers for each leaf which is written as H(A) H(B) in the book's diagram. Instead, it contains a single hash of both A and B concatenated, that is  denoted as H(A||B).

Further, there are no pointers which let you instantly hop from the parent to its children. The only way to find the child given a parent in practice is by using index arithmetic because all of the nodes in a binary tree can be denoted using indexing. And indexing follows a structure that lets you navigate the tree.

I claim the above misunderstanding leads to a further misunderstanding regarding a proof of membership. As I understand, a proof of membership is the same as a proof of inclusion and a merkle proof.

Here is the text from the book:

>Proof of membership. Another nice feature of Merkle trees is that, unlike the block chain that we built before, it allows a concise proof of membership. Say that someone wants to prove that a certain data block is a member of the Merkle Tree. As usual, we remember just the root. Then they need to show us this data block, and the blocks on the path from the data block to the root. We can ignore the rest of the tree, as the blocks on this path are enough to allow us to verify the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. See Figure 1.8 for a graphical depiction of how this works.

Here is a diagram they provide:

[https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png)

REBUTTAL: Consider a trivial example of a merkle tree where it contains 3 nodes.  It has a root. The root has 2 children(leaf nodes in this case). Also assume a merkle tree is structured as I claim: The leaf nodes contain hashes of their corresponding datablocks. The parents of these leaf nodes contain the hash of the concatenated child hashes. And any further parents are recursively constructed in the same fashion.

Given this simple case, let the datablocks be denoted as A and B. Then one leaf node contains H(A) and the other contains H(B). The parent contains the hash H( H(A) || H(B) ).

I want to prove the membership of the datablock A. The book claims I need only provide the direct path from root to leaf node of A. And I claim this is NOT enough information. Suppose I do as the book states and provide the root and the leaf node containing H(A). First providing the leaf node H(A) is actually redundant. Anyone can fabricate the correct hash of a datablock on the fly. What we really want is a piece of information that confirms H(A) is indeed part of this tree where the hashes propagate upward to the root - and where the root is combined authenticator for all the elements in the tree. Ok so maybe adding the root will provide enough information? If I observe the hash stored in the root which is the output of H(H(A)||H(B)). Well this is NOT helpful! How can I confirm that H(A) was propagated upwards into the root and passed into a hash with H(B) concatenated. I have H(A), but I'm missing half of the input so how can I possibly reproduce the output of H(H(A)||H(B)) to verify? The only way to verify would be if I was provided H(B).

I claim the information that must be provided are the sibling nodes along the direct route from leaf to root which contradicts the claims in the book.

CryptoTechnology,Why Prediction Markets Will Be the Future of Crypto,EventX_Official,73,1738442494.0,"Crypto has gone through a lot of trends—Bitcoin as “digital gold,” Ethereum and smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and whatever else people have hyped up. But one of the most interesting (and underrated) use cases is prediction markets. I honestly think they could be a huge part of crypto’s future.

# What’s a prediction market?

It’s basically a way to bet on real-world events—elections, sports, stock prices, anything. If you think something will happen, you buy “Yes” shares. If you think it won’t, you buy “No” shares. The price moves based on what people believe the probability is. It’s like a stock market for real-world events.

# Why does this matter for crypto?

* They’re actually useful – Instead of just trading meme coins, prediction markets provide real-world value by showing what people *really* think will happen.
* Less censorship – A lot of places ban certain types of betting (especially political betting), but decentralized markets are harder to shut down.
* One of the best real uses for crypto – People always ask what crypto is actually *good for*. This is one of the best answers.
* Better than traditional betting – No middlemen, lower fees, and the odds are set by the market instead of bookies.

Platforms like Polymarket and Augur are already doing this, but it still feels early. If crypto is going to have real-world applications, **prediction markets could be one of the biggest.**

Curious to hear what others think—are prediction markets the next big thing, or is something holding them back?"

This is what I got and please correct me if I have mistakes and I'm open for discussion down in the comment sections so feel free! 

**Key Differences Between Bitcoin and XRP Algorithms**

**Consensus Mechanism**:

* **Bitcoin**: Uses **Proof of Work (PoW)**, where miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. This process is **energy-intensive** and relatively **slow**.
* **XRP (Ripple)**: Uses the **Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)**, which relies on a network of **trusted validators (Will talk about these later)** to reach consensus on transactions. It is **faster**, more **energy-efficient**, and does not require mining.

  
**Transaction Speed**:

* **Bitcoin**: **10 minutes** on average due to the time required to mine each block.
* **XRP**:  **3-5 seconds** due to its lightweight consensus algorithm. Very fast.

  
**Scalability (TPS-wise)**:

* **Bitcoin**: Processes about **7 transactions per second (TPS)**. Scaling has been a challenge due to its block size and consensus model (?)
* **XRP**: Can handle up to **1,500 TPS**, making it more suitable for large-scale, high-frequency use cases like global payments.

  
**Purpose**:

* **Bitcoin**: Designed as a **decentralized digital currency** and store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold.""
* **XRP**: Primarily developed as a **bridge currency** for cross-border payments and facilitating fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions.

# Combined Benefits for Financial Technology:

1. **Improved Efficiency**: Bitcoin’s decentralization and XRP’s speed/low cost can complement each other in creating hybrid systems that are both secure and scalable.
2. **Reduced Costs**: Both cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies in transaction and operational costs between countries.
3. **Innovation in Payment Systems**: By integrating blockchain technology, Bitcoin and XRP can inspire new solutions for digital payments, lending, and ""**ASSET""** tokenization.

  
Some questions that I have:

1. Can both co-exist with each other later?  
2. Is XRP decentralized or centralized?  

* Validators on the XRP Ledger include universities, financial institutions, and independent organizations, making the network less reliant on Ripple Labs.
* Since Ripple Labs created XRP and still holds a significant portion of its supply (over 40 billion XRP in escrow). This concentration of ownership can give Ripple Labs significant influence over the XRP market, defeat the purpose of decentralized currency like bitcoin.

  
Please correct me if I have any mistakes and I hope we could learn from each other :) Thank you!"

CryptoTechnology,Verifiable AI with TEEs and Blockchain,rayQuGR,85,1736769224.0,"AI systems are becoming increasingly powerful, but how can we trust their outputs and ensure they’re processed securely? Oasis Protocol is addressing this by combining Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with blockchain technology to deliver verifiable AI.

Here’s how it works:

* **What Are TEEs?** TEEs are secure hardware environments that isolate sensitive data and computations, protecting them from unauthorized access or tampering. Think of them as a vault for processing data while keeping it private.
* **Blockchain Integration**: By coupling TEEs with Oasis’s blockchain, computations performed inside these secure enclaves can be verified using cryptographic proofs. This guarantees that the AI models and their outputs haven’t been altered.
* **Why It Matters**: This combination enables decentralized applications to maintain both transparency and privacy, solving a key issue for industries that rely on sensitive data, such as:
   * **Healthcare**: Securely analyzing patient data without exposing it to breaches.
   * **Finance**: Ensuring fraud detection algorithms operate as intended without bias or interference.
   * **Government and Compliance**: Proving compliance with regulations while maintaining data confidentiality.

Oasis Protocol is paving the way for AI systems to gain trust in critical applications where verifiability is essential. By leveraging TEEs, they ensure computations are not only private but also provably correct—offering a balance of security and accountability.

 "
CryptoTechnology,Blockchains algorithm full privacy ,EvilCorpRobot,369,1736085088.0,"Hello Reddit!

I'm excited to share with you all an innovative approach to blockchain security and privacy that I’ve been working on. The core idea of this algorithm is to enhance both transaction confidentiality and user anonymity without compromising the integrity of the blockchain itself. This is achieved primarily through the use of pseudonyms for each transaction, and I'd love to explain how it works!

Key Features:

1. Pseudonyms for Sender and Receiver:
Every transaction on the blockchain involves a pseudo-generated public address for both the sender and the receiver. These pseudonyms are essentially temporary identities tied to a private key that can only be used for that specific transaction. By doing so, the blockchain ensures that there is no direct link between the user’s real-world identity and their on-chain activities, enhancing privacy.

2. Transaction Fragmentation:
Transactions are fragmented into smaller parts that are independently validated, meaning that even if parts of the transaction are intercepted, it becomes nearly impossible to reconstruct the full transaction. This ensures extra layers of security and privacy.

3. Dual Validation by Two Groups of Miners:
To further enhance security, two separate groups of miners validate different aspects of each transaction. This reduces the risk of malicious actions and ensures that the integrity of the transaction is always maintained.

4. Cryptographic Protections:
I’ve incorporated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), ring signatures, and other advanced cryptographic techniques to guarantee that transaction details remain private while still allowing for secure verification on the blockchain.

Why Pseudonyms?

The use of pseudonyms in this system allows for complete privacy—even when transactions are verified, there is no way to trace back the transaction to any real-world identity unless the user explicitly reveals it. This is a key feature for anyone concerned with maintaining their privacy in a blockchain environment.

Additionally, it provides a layer of security against tracking and surveillance by making it incredibly difficult to correlate transactions between different pseudonyms, even if they are used by the same person.

What’s Next?

I’m hoping to take this concept further and eventually bring it to the real world. The system is designed to be scalable, meaning it can grow alongside the adoption of blockchain technology while maintaining privacy and security for all users.

If you’re into blockchain tech, privacy, or cryptography, I’d love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!


This blockchain algorithm uses pseudonyms for both sender and receiver, transaction fragmentation, and dual miner validation to ensure maximum privacy and security while maintaining a transparent and secure blockchain ledger."

You could prove the inputs for each iteration of the loop outputs the inputs for the next iteration of the loop. This is highly parallelisable and the polynomials involved would be tiny making inversion steps much simpler.

crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,daidoji70,8,1738686368.0,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,fosres,2,1738637160.0,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Still on the cypherpunk mailing list in 2000 under his dnet .com email

Wrote a manifesto in 2001 about making a mark without leaving a trace

Subscriber to cryptome.org in 2001


Early Signs of a Bitcoin-like Mindset

In 2003, Dorsey posted a bio mentioning his interest in crypto, pseudonyms, and 4 AM hacks

That same year, he declared he was ending his dependence on the U.S. dollar and was creating a barter network

Used the pseudonym ""Jak"" instead of Jack


Suspiciously Timed Events Around Bitcoin’s Birth

August 17, 2008: Jack, an avid sailor, tweets: ""Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way."" Bitcoin.org is registered the next day.

His Twitter bio from Sept '07 - Jan '09 mentioned that he was a sailor.

The original Bitcoin source code contains an old sailor’s adage: ""Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.""

Bitcoin’s source code documents were timestamped at exactly 4 AM, aligning with Jack’s known hacking hours.

Bitcoin’s source code includes a brute-forced vanity address starting with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7), timestamped 1/7/09.

January 10, 2009: Satoshi accidentally logs into IRC revealing a California IP address—Jack was in California.

A Work of Art or a Hidden Truth?

The prevailing belief that Satoshi never wanted to be found is an assumption created by others. Jack himself has clarified that Satoshi chose pseudonymity, not anonymity. Given his deep involvement in cryptography, early Bitcoin-era events aligning with personal milestones, and his long-time cryptic nods to Satoshi, is it possible that Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin as a form of digital art? A masterpiece of financial revolution?

Or is he simply the ultimate Bitcoin enthusiast, subtly playing into the mystery?

What do you think? Could Jack Dorsey really be Satoshi Nakamoto?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the FIRST month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 FEB Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **JAN Highlights:** Mixed month, but overall up.  **XRP** nabs the monthly lead followed by **SOL**.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+323% vs S&P500's +766% - see below for details).

# Month One – Up +7%

https://preview.redd.it/trx8sjru1bje1.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcfb2b9a3a84d8b1c7bb96218ff95a1873cf86e5

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

January highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **XRP** and **SOL** lead the way
* Mixed month, but gains outpace losses 

# January Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/bzr1catv1bje1.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=3634081a2542903b9d2017dd280b0afdae59a6e9

# January Winners and Losers

***January Winners*** – **XRP** (+38%) easily took the monthly victory followed by **SOL** (+20%)

***January Losers*** – **AVAX** (-5%) and **BNB** (-4%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: A mixed but mostly green start to the year

In contrast to [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1), this year is off to a fairly good start (the 2024 Top Ten portfolio was down -14% after one month).

**XRP** is out to an early lead (up +38% in January) followed by **SOL**, +20% so far in 2025.  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** thirty days ago is worth $138 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The portfolio gained $66 (+7%) in January so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$1,066.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, one month later: 

https://preview.redd.it/cai0brxy1bje1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=527600a5a248fa851922b1157ea4c25fce7e9d3a

**January Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +7% 
* **COIN50**: +3%

The January monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +73% (total value $1,725)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +761% (total value $8,612)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +1010% (total value $11,098) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +391% (total value $4,911)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up +5% (total value $1046) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +240% (total value $3,399)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +100% (total value $1,998)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +7% (total value $1,066)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$33,855**

https://preview.redd.it/s8v0vci12bje1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf7abe1e229b0ac861308ffbb4d021049b16acc

**That’s up +323%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hbnt3pe22bje1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ca9d18c0995634af7a64b2d7b23b71313f9a5

In summary: ***That’s a +323% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,027 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,260 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,411 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,870 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,608 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,268 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,574 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,266 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,027 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,284.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+323%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

CryptoCurrency,The fact we have continual focus on price and such shows 99% only care about a profit. Is that true for everyone?,setokaiba22,32,1739657923.0,"I feel nearly every single article or post here and on ‘news’ sites just has a focus on breakouts, price charts and such. There’s very ever little focus on the technology (perhaps with Musk’s actions lately that’s swayed a little), but arguably 99% of the interest in Cryptocurrency is purely about making money.

It’s become the same as a stock or share in its focus and reporting. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing really - it’s why many coins have the value they have today. And why we see big companies pump and dump.

Is actually holding or buying because they think the technology is great or say Bitcoin will become a major currency or is it everybody is just here to make money and hope it takes off more?"

CryptoCurrency,Is Crypto Nullifying Safe Gambling?,Howdoibuycrypto,1,1739676831.0,"Every day, as part of my career in the crypto casino space, I see more and more no-KYC casinos popping up. At first, it’s easy to see the appeal obviously, instant sign ups, total anonymity, no verification waiting times. Just deposit your crypto and start playing. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder: is this actually a good thing?

These casinos, despite being licensed in various jurisdictions, don’t ask for ID, proof of age, or any personal details. That means literally anyone with crypto can deposit, gamble, and withdraw their winnings with zero true oversight. That includes minors, problem gamblers, and even people looking to use these platforms for malicious reasons. And yet, people celebrate this as a feature, not a flaw or at least something we should keep an eye on, if not even intervene somehow. 

I get the privacy argument. Nobody wants to hand over sensitive personal data to a company they barely trust. We’ve all heard horror stories of leaked databases, identity theft, and government overreach. And let’s be real, traditional online casinos are a bureaucratic nightmare when it comes to withdrawals. Not just from a KYC POV but also from a payout time POV. KYC delays, frozen accounts, endless document requests—it’s frustrating. So, I completely understand why people want no-KYC casinos and it’s only crypto that seems to be able to offer that right now. 

But here’s where it gets dark for me at least:

Underage gambling – A 15-year-old with access to Bitcoin or USDT can gamble with ease. No ID, no questions asked.

Problem gambling – Without KYC, there are no self-exclusion programs, no deposit limits, no real way to intervene if someone is spiraling into addiction.

Financial crime risks – Crypto already has a reputation for being used in money laundering. No-KYC casinos make it even easier to move funds under the radar.

So, where do we draw the line? Should privacy take full priority, even if it means opening the doors to these risks? Or should the industry find a middle ground such as maybe allowing small transactions without KYC but requiring verification for larger amounts? Some casinos are already exploring this hybrid approach. Is that the best way forward for the industry? Keep both parties equally only half-happy?

I’m really curious about what others think. Are no-KYC casinos a step toward financial freedom, in the sense of giving you control of your identity— even when  it comes to A CASINO, or are they a ticking time bomb for responsible gambling?"
CryptoCurrency,Tipping system like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee but with crypto ?,Nayko93,12,1739638493.0,"Hi

I'm looking for a way to accept small tips and donations from users in my community  
I will probably make a Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee account, but those services only accept fiat money via stripe, cashapp, paypal... and I know some people don't like to use those and would prefer sending a tip in crypto (well known crypto that are easy to deal with and widely accepted, so bitcoin ethereum and monero)

So I've looked online for a tipping platform like those 2 but with crypto, but I can't find anything useful, not even a reddit post talking about the idea, which I find really weird

The ONLY thing I've found is this website called ""cwallet"", but it seem fishy as hell, the website itself look like something big and professional, but except the website itself, there is absolutely no info about it online, no one talking about it on reddit or any other forums

So I'm asking all of you here, is there such a thing as a platform where you can receive tips in crypto that redirect them to your wallet ?

Please it have to be something SIMPLE like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee

I know I could simply give my wallet address directly or a QR code and tell people to donate there, BUT I want to offer small compensation for the tips like special roles and customisation on discord, so I need the person tipping to be able to send a small message with their username with the tip

I also know that ultimately I could make a webage with a crypto paiement tool, something where you select the amount you want to give, it generate a QR code for the right amount to my wallet, it allow people to enter a small message that I would receive by mail or something, and the system check the blockchain to see if the paiement is real and once it's confirmed it send the mail with the confirmation + the user's message...  
But this is faaaar beyond what I can do...

Thanks for your help :)"
CryptoCurrency,Paycheck to Crypto supported paltform,LazyBedsheet,1,1739672377.0,"Hi All,

I am from the US, and I used to use Coinbase's paycheck feature where a part of my paycheck that gets deposited into coinbase was used to automatically but set crypto at no additional fees.

Now, this feature is removed by coinbase, and I am looking for a platform with this similar feature.
The advantage of this feature was I didn't had to move money when I received the paycheck (and there weren't any explicit fees).

Do you have any suggestions on any platforms available in US that currently supports this feature?"

""This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,"" he said, adding he would ""absolutely not"" give up.

The value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about £620m, Mr Howells said ""it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this"" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies.

My theory is there might not even be a hard drive he's doing this for the publicity and in the UK you get paid for certain articles written about you.

The question I do have is who are these so called investors that he's mentioned, if he does buy the landfill and the hard drive is broken how is he going to pay them."
CryptoCurrency,question regarding on how to determine position size,BadBLUNT,0,1739674128.0,"i created this example to help me with this formula i found in the book called ""The crypto trader"" by **Glen Goodman** and idk if i got it right i spent like an hour or so trying to figure it out sicne it was so confusing so if u guys can tell me if i understood the formula right that would be really nice heres the formula :

  
total budget : $100 000



price of the crypto ATM : $0.91



ATR on 30 days : $0.129



price i bought at : $0.91



price of my stop loss : 0.714





so to my determine position size i should determine the difference between the price i bought at versus the stop loss (support line)



0.91 - 0.714 = 0.196

price bought at - stop loss = the money risked per coin 



since i only want to risk 1% or less of my total capital i multiply by 5000 the money risked per coin to make it to $980 (wich is 0.98% of 100 000)

0.196 x 5000 = 980



now that i know that i want 5000 coin lets multiply the ATR by 5000 so it matches the the equation we did before 

0.129 x 5000 = 645





now with those position i can say that i have 1.51 ATR (wich means if the crypto goes 1 and a half days downward at a rate of 0.129 per coin (or by $645 since i bought 5000 coin) the stop order will be trigered

CryptoMarkets,Looking for a community,Wilderone-r,1,1739699519.0,"Hi there!

  
I'm learning how to work with investments and have decided to specialize in crypto.  
Since both finance and tokenomics are new to me, I'm learning them from scratch.

  
My ultimate goal is to achieve sustainable profits from my investments and find a job in the crypto investing field.  
My approach is to understand the fundamentals of both finance and tokenomics through study (mainly books) and practice.

  
Right now, I desperately need a community of like-minded people. Preferably a closed, possibly paid community with mentors—without speculation, memecoin advice, or crazy ""THIS WILL MAKE ME RICH"" gamblers.

Any advice?"

CryptoMarkets,$Trump 40% Pump Fishy,thebanksmoney,363,1739559813.0,"All of a sudden $trump coin surges 40% in last 24hours.

Does anybody else think it is weird to have a sitting president that directly profits from something that can be easily manipulated with no transparency of buyers strange and scary?

I mean Russia could be pumping millions into the coin with no intention of selling back because Trump is going to force Ukraine to succeed territory therefore helping Russia with war .

You don’t really even have to go down any rabbit holes to think of other type deals. 

Trump has already made 100 million just on fees. So the long game does not have to end with $trump being worth anything when he could sell in a year with the 80% unlock scheme.

CryptoMarkets,A Short Reminder,MVazovski,3,1739651998.0,"Hello all,

I am posting this as a mere reminder of who you shouldn't trust. You shouldn't trust rich people, celebrities, influencers, people you watch videos of every day, people who follow something blindly and can't explain in short, simple terms as to why you should invest in something. Now, the presidents are also added to the list. Until today, it was limited to US, now Argentina. Soon, the other countries and their presidents will follow suit. Remember how a lot of people got dumped NFTs on them and are still holding the bags today. Remember how there were so many scammers in 2021 and 2022. The numbers will definitely go up.

For degens, it spells opportunity, more people will fall for scams and more people will lose money, some degens will try hopping on the hypetrain early so they can 10x or 20x their money and dump on unsuspecting people. 

Please do not trust anyone. If you care about your loved ones, friends, family and you have been talking to them about crypto currencies, please inform them about the risks of so called ""meme""coins or ""utility"" coins which ""promise"" to ""change the game"" or some other bs.

Remember: Diamond hands, paper hands, FUD... these are just buzzwords to keep you in whatever scam someone is pulling (even though FUD is a real term used in a different context, not scams). Nobody wants to lose anyone that is buying into their scam because that means more money for them. 

Stay safe out there, people. God bless."
CryptoMarkets,BTC - the jig is up,StrategyComplete9982,1,1739669482.0,"Plan B, a person that some of you may follow. i personally think he is nothing more than a common average intelligence used bitcoin salesmen (thats what i call the btc influencers who make stupid predictions that never come true). His stock to flow chart (the only thing he did), is not holding up this cycle. Last week he was calling for 500k, now he moved all his btc to ETFS. His entire holding into ETFs. What does that mean?  It likely means he believes the years of crazy volatility (where you make money) are over. No longer will BTC drop 5x -25x from top to bottom allowing you to 5x -25x your money if you play the cycles. The jig is up, there are no new retailers bc everyone is onto the cycle theory, everyone knows this. The ETFs will provide a price floor. So by moving to ETFs, he is saying, without saying that there is may not be anymore cycles to play.  Is this good or bad, I am not smart enough to figure that out. If it is TRUE and the cycles are very reduced (say we only drop to 70k from here for the bear), the ONLY way BTC goes up is new money. No more of the same people buying and selling to each other as has happened in BTCs history. Need massive new adoption asap. Thoughts?"

I would still file my taxes in fiat as usual, so compliance isn’t an issue—I just want to keep my money outside of a bank. (i had very bad experience in the past, me obeying the law, but they obviously not and abusing their powers, so i am not trusting them anymore)

Are there any payment processors that support this setup? Ideally, I’d like something that:

* Accepts standard payment methods (Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
* Automatically converts the received fiat to stablecoins
* Deposits the stablecoins directly into my wallet
* Operates in a tax-compliant and legal manner

Has anyone found a good solution for this? Looking for recommendations!

Or do you have a certain set of coins you are always observing?

CryptoMarkets,Why Are Some of the Best Crypto Projects Still Overlooked?,Ok-Western-5799,36,1739524967.0,"It’s interesting how some projects seem to be making real progress under the radar while others dominate headlines just off hype. I’ve been looking at different metrics, TVL growth, real adoption, network upgrades, and it’s clear that some ecosystems are quietly getting stronger without making much noise.



Take EOS, for example. It had a reputation for years as an ""old"" project, but if you actually check the numbers, it’s been making serious moves. TVL is near an all-time high, adoption is increasing, and the latest upgrades (like the Antelope Spring update) have improved efficiency and tokenomics. It’s even part of the Coin50 Index, which tracks the strongest smart contract platforms in the market, and it’s currently the second-best performer in that category.



But despite all that, it’s not a name you see constantly hyped on CT or Reddit. Maybe it’s just because newer projects steal the spotlight, or people still associate it with the past, but I feel like narratives shift fast in crypto. We’ve seen it before—Solana was “dead” in 2022, and now it’s everywhere again.



Another one I’ve been keeping an eye on is Kaspa (KAS). It’s been flying under the radar but has a unique approach with its blockDAG structure, allowing high-speed transactions while maintaining decentralization. Unlike a lot of L1s, it doesn’t rely on gimmicks—it’s pure proof-of-work but with a design that solves a lot of Bitcoin’s scaling issues. The adoption is slow but steady, and if you look at its trajectory, it feels like one of those projects that could explode when the market catches on.



What other projects do you guys think are building quietly while the market focuses on the same handful of names? Are there any ecosystems you’re watching that you think will get more attention once the market picks up?"

CryptoMarkets,XRP ETF Looks Like A Reality,ExtremeWhitewaterGuy,36,1739496548.0,"
The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale and NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF. The countdown to the approval of several spot XRP ETFs has begun.
The SEC has just given a green light to Grayscale’s proposal for a Spot XRP ETF by officially acknowledging the 19b-4 filing submitted via NYSE Arca—and now they’re calling on the public for feedback. In the filing posted last Thursday, the commission set a 21-day deadline for comments after the notice hits the Federal Register. Once that window closes, the SEC will decide whether to give this ETF the thumbs-up, knock it back, or even open up formal proceedings.

This 19b-4 filing is a crucial second step in launching a spot XRP ETF. Once it’s published in the Federal Register, the regulatory process really kicks into gear.

Recently, a slew of crypto ETFs—from Solana to Dogecoin—have been on the SEC’s radar as firms test the waters for regulatory approval.

The Crypto Thaw
This shift comes as the SEC appears to be easing up on its crypto stance following former Chair Gary Gensler’s departure last month. Gensler was famously skeptical, often labeling most cryptocurrencies as securities. In contrast, the agency has already approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and later, spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a more welcoming environment for digital assets.

Asset managers including WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have each submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF would allow investors to gain direct exposure to XRP without the hassle of holding the coin. This isn’t just a clever piece of financial engineering—it’s a potential game-changer that bridges the gap between traditional Wall Street and the fast-moving crypto frontier.

These filings are more than just regulatory checkboxes; they’re statements of intent. The idea is to democratize access to XRP, inviting both retail investors and institutional titans to partake in what many see as the next big chapter in crypto history.

Today the SEC acknowledged Grayscale and the NYSE’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF.  It’s the bullish XRP news that Ripple watchers have been waiting for. 

xrp price prediction

XRP ETFs are close to approval wrote Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X

Green Light Soon?
The SEC’s nod to the XRP 19b-4 filings isn’t just a bureaucratic checkbox—it’s a pivotal move in the ETF approval saga. While it doesn’t guarantee approval, it clearly shows that the wheels are turning. If, and when an XRP ETF does eventually get the green light, we could be staring down the barrel of a major institutional investment wave, one that’s likely to boost liquidity and demand significantly.

With regulatory clarity inching closer and Ripple making bold strides on the global stage, we have to ask: Are we on the verge of witnessing XRP’s metamorphosis from a mere utility asset into a bona fide mainstream financial instrument? If so, this isn’t just evolution—it’s a revolution that could upend traditional investment paradigms. XRP to the moon.

A Shifting Regulatory Landscape
With pro-crypto President Trump in charge, and new SEC chair Paul Atkins at the helm—whose track record hints at a more open-minded approach to digital assets—the stage is set for XRP ETF applications to clear the regulatory hurdle.

This potential pivot isn’t just about XRP—it’s emblematic of a broader transformation in how regulators might handle digital assets. For contrarians like us, it’s a fascinating development. While some fear that regulatory embrace could water down the decentralized ethos of crypto, others see it as the inevitable maturation of a market that’s been too raw for too long.

Market Impact: Bulls Charging, Bears on Alert
The ripple effects of these ETF applications could be huge. Analysts are already speculating that if approved, these ETFs could inject between $4 billion and $8 billion in net new assets into the XRP ecosystem within the first year. That’s not chump change—it’s a tidal wave of capital that could drive XRP’s price and liquidity to new heights. That means XRP price predictions for 2025 will have to be adjusted higher. As you can see on the XRP price chart below, the XRP price moved 4% higher on today’s news.

CryptoMarkets,SOLANA vs BNB (Binance),Current_You_,0,1739529343.0,"**Binance** and **Solana** are fundamentally different in their scope, centralization, and market influence. Here’s a breakdown:

# 1. Centralization & Business Model

* **Binance (BNB Chain & Binance Exchange)**:
   * Binance is a **fully centralized** company with a regulatory presence (despite facing scrutiny in some countries).
   * It operates a **crypto exchange**, which is one of the largest globally, alongside **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**.
   * Binance has multiple business arms, including Binance Pay, Binance NFT, Binance Academy, and more.
   * **BNB Coin** is used for trading fee discounts, DeFi, staking, and various exchange-related utilities.
* **Solana (SOL)**:
   * Solana is a **decentralized blockchain** focused purely on **speed and scalability** with a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus model.
   * It doesn’t have a centralized company backing it the way Binance does.
   * While Solana has strong DeFi and NFT adoption, it has suffered from **network outages** multiple times.
   * SOL is mainly used for **network fees, staking, and DeFi applications**.

# 2. Market Influence & Use Cases

* **Binance (BNB)**
   * Operates a **trading empire** handling billions of dollars daily.
   * Has a **real-world company structure**, giving it more legitimacy and operational security.
   * BNB has multiple utilities **inside and outside** of Binance, making it more integrated into the crypto world.
* **Solana (SOL)**
   * Purely a **blockchain network** competing with Ethereum.
   * Its growth is fueled by **NFTs, DeFi, and smart contract applications**.
   * Unlike Binance, Solana does not have a centralized exchange or company to support its stability.

# 3. Market Capitalization & Longevity

* Historically, **BNB has been more resilient** than SOL due to its **centralized backing and multiple revenue streams**.
* Solana, on the other hand, has seen **more volatility** and suffered major crashes in the past.
* **BNB is usually more stable than SOL** because of Binance’s **business model and exchange dominance**.

# Which is “Bigger”?

* **In terms of market cap**, they are **very close** (BNB recently surpassed SOL again).
* **In terms of real-world influence, Binance (BNB) is bigger** because it’s an entire **ecosystem + exchange**, while **Solana is just a blockchain**.

**Final Take: Binance (BNB) is more stable and influential in the crypto space than Solana (SOL)** because it is backed by an entire **business ecosystem**, whereas **Solana relies only on its blockchain adoption**."
CryptoMarkets,"Why do so few traders keep a journal, even though it’s one of the best ways to improve?",AdCultural4935,4,1739501316.0,"Hi, just wanted to rant a little bit.

Everyone says keeping a trading journal is crucial for improvement, but from what Ive seen, most traders dont do it at all.

I know its tedious to manually write down every trade, especially when you’re trading multiple pairs or scalping. But after forcing myself to review my trades regularly (i automated it cause manual is a pain in the ass), I realized it helped way more than I expected.

Seeing recurring mistakes helped me cut them out.

\- Tracking setups showed me which ones actually worked vs. just “felt good.”

\- Decomposing of returns (Do i have an edge irrelevant of conditions or is just market drift moving my positions?

\- A big part of the ""confidence"" component comes from systematizing your trading and recording the results. Data exhaust from your own trading is more valuable than any information the market can give you, and its impossible to know how things are going if you dont follow your own rules. Let data be your confidence.

\- Reducing costs is free alpha with zero volatility. People genuinely understimate how much not executing properly tanks your profits.

That said, I still feel like most traders dont journal. Is it just because its too much work, or do people not realize the huge benefits it provides? Do you guys track your trades in any way?

CryptoMoonShots,"UAE, DAMAC, Sovereign Funds... Why is $OM MANTRA pumping, and is it just getting started?",MrPenghu,880,1739645043.0,"Been watching something interesting in crypto space and wanted to share my thoughts.

$OM hit $8 today with a +40% jump. What's crazy is this happened without even being listed on any major US or Korean exchanges yet, means that market is basically untouched.

Some stuff I noticed:

* Started around $0.20 just 12 months ago—now up **3,900%** to hit $8.
* Best performer during the bear market and team is expanding 
* Building for real estate tokenization
* Getting serious backing

Here's what caught my eye recently: Abu Dhabi's Mubadala (their huge wealth fund) just bought $436M in Bitcoin ETFs in Q4. Interesting timing because MANTRA got $11M funding led by Shorooq Partners, and they're backed by these same big funds - Mubadala, JADA, Saudi Venture Capital, and ADQ.

What's interesting is seeing big real estate players like DAMAC actually getting involved. Not just announcements - they're actually planning to put properties on the blockchain and they have picked MANTRA Chain after exploring all other options.

The market moves are pretty interesting right now. SUI and SOL performed well, and now institutional money seems to be quietly moving into RWA stuff. And UAE isn't slowing down their crypto push at all - they're going all in.

Looking at all this - the institutional backing, real estate connections, and major exchange listings in Korea, US - makes me wonder if we might see $OM in the top 10 this year? Doesn't seem crazy given they're one of the few projects with actual real big deals which includes MAG, Novus.

Real world assets are finally moving from all talk to actual use. Pretty interesting to watch, especially with big finance looking to get into crypto the proper way.

If I share in short, I see everything will be tokenized and MANTRA is going to capture a lot more of the market share.

What do you guys think?

When you read posts like this they always make it seem like there aren’t problems and you’re an idiot for not buying the token being shilled. But look I’ll be 100% honest with you here meme tokens are STRUGGLING. And hard. And snake wif hat on the surface the price is struggling like many other meme tokens. Look at doge, dogwifhat, hege, and anarchy. These are all common memes I see listed here a lot and in other subs and their communities are all saying the same thing. I can’t vouch for those communities or say anything negative about them because I don’t frequent their chat groups. 

What I can say is that if these tokens are able to keep their community together and keep the vibes high even during the bad times they will find success and the holders will be greatly rewarded. I CAN vouch for snake wif hat as I am in the chat frequently and this community is going to stick it out until the very end. There are times where it’s not perfect. The news is slow the price dips and the weaker handed people leave because they can’t stomach the movement. Arguments can happen in chat because in a community there are many ideas of what is the correct way to grow.

Forget small moves, this is the BIG BRO of the meme world, bringing massive energy, unstoppable hype, and GIGABRAIN market moves.

**Why $GIGABRO is Built Different:**

 The BIGGEST Meme on Solana – This ain’t your regular broccoli. $GIGABRO is supersized, giga-powered, and ready to dominate the meme scene.

 Solana’s Green Giant – Just like Solana’s blazing speed, $GIGABRO is here to grow fast and take over. Forget lag, this is full-speed memecoin action.

 GIGABRAIN Trading Moves – Only the smartest degens will recognize the opportunity. Big brain. Big plays. Big wins. That’s $GIGABRO.

 A Meme With True Strength – Weak hands won’t survive. $GIGABRO is built for the strongest, the boldest, and the ones who know when a giga-trend is about to explode.

**How High Can GIGA BROCCOLI Go?**

They said meme coins couldn’t get bigger—$GIGABRO proved them wrong. They said crypto was done—$GIGABRO is bringing it back. This isn’t just a token, it’s a movement, a meme revolution, a giga-force of nature.

- 🟢 A GIGA meme for a GIGA market.
- 🟢 A GIGA community ready to send.
- 🟢 A GIGA run waiting to happen.

**Get In Now—Before It’s Too Big to Catch!**

Why BROCCOLI Stands Out
Strong Tokenomics – A well-balanced supply mechanism prevents inflation while encouraging long-term holding.
DeFi Integration – Staking and yield farming offer passive income opportunities.
Real-World Utility – A portion of transactions funds sustainability projects, making every trade count.
Community-Driven – Governance mechanisms allow holders to vote on ecosystem developments.
Upcoming NFT Collection – Exclusive NFT drops linked to green initiatives provide unique incentives.
The Roadmap
BROCCOLI is not a short-term hype project. The team has outlined clear milestones, including CEX listings, strategic partnerships, and decentralized governance enhancements. With a dedicated development team and an engaged community, BROCCOLI aims to set a new standard for sustainable crypto projects.

CryptoMoonShots,Let’s Collectively Stop Letting the Insiders Win,JOxen89,6,1739681962.0,"If you actually opened this post I’d like to think you’re just as fed up with what’s happening in this space as I am. Everyday, insiders and cabals are taking money from the Solana ecosystem and lining their bank accounts with it. Even all these supposed “Key Opinion Leaders” are now preaching a world of PvP or lose everything.

THIS IS NOT WHAT CRYPTO HAS BEEN ABOUT ALL THESE YEARS. All of this PvP is ripping away one of the most important, if not the MOST important thing…Community!

We can’t continue on in this space with this mentality. These insiders are the only ones set up to win within this type of system, using their power and influence to take your money. Meanwhile, the rest of us become more divided, jaded and frustrated. 

I’m here to put out a call to arms for all of crypto reddit. We used to come together and PvE a coin to insane heights. I know it’s still possible if we decided to work together, and take down the insiders and cabals.

Obviously, this is where I will insert my \**shill*\* and I’m sure the comments will be flooded with even more people saying why their coin is the best. But, let me explain why I think it should be this coin.

Step in $HEGE.

Hege is the underdog of this crazy crypto world. It’s literally about a Hedgehog that’s trying to win over the girl of his dreams, from some bro type a\*\*hole. We’re all in crypto trying to make something of ourselves, just like Hege, the main character of the story.

Let’s get into some details.

Hege is going on 10 months, and 10 days as of today. That alone is an insane feat in this space. The coin currently stands at a $10m MC and has had an ATH of $53m. It has survived multiple pullbacks and has always come back stronger.

It’s the first at something. It’s the first story based meme coin where chapters unlock at certain market caps. At $50m MC, we unlocked Chapter 5, and we have 5 more to go before we complete the first volume. This allows for some pretty unique content, since there are multiple character arcs, and always something new as chapters unlock. Imitated, but never duplicated, other coins have tried to copy $HEGE’s narrative, but all have failed and gone to 0.

The artwork that has been created over the last 10 months is PLENTIFUL. There’s so many little side stories made up of the other characters. Several chapters of the Hege story have been fully animated. There’s also been a constant surge of new artists coming in to put their own twist on $HEGE. And my favorite is the DRiP\_HAUS collabs, because they’ve opened the door for new, reimagined versions of Hege created by insanely talented artists! Just today they launched the Rogue Hege collection and it sold out within 2 mins at a 2 SOL mint price!

There’s even added utility to the Hegend NFT collection, which pays out a monthly reward to holders. As long as you hold an NFT, plus Hege, you get paid in Hege just for holding! This is all paid for by NFT royalties in the secondary market. Also, the Hegend artwork is just dope in general.

Lastly, and to bring it around full circle.. (but not last because there are so many other things I could talk about in the Hege universe..)

The COMMUNITY! The people in Hege are weirdly enough, just like Hege. They are kind. They are willing to lend a helping hand. They are the underdogs. They want to stick it to the insiders and cabals and prove that good people can make waves in this space. So many people comment on how the Hege community is special… and it is! You should come experience it for yourself and see if it’s something you want to align with.

Because I think $HEGE is the one we should all PvE on and send a big middle finger to the cabals and insiders, and maybe you’ll agree with me. Maybe not. Regardless, I hope we all make it in this crazy world, despite the daily barrage of assholes trying to scam us out of our hard earned money."
CryptoMoonShots,Snake Wif Hat (SSSSS),MaxCawke,177,1739614463.0,"Attention, crypto enthusiasts! The next big thing on Solana is here, and it's called Snake Wif Hat. This isn't just another memecoin; it's a cultural shift, a meme, and an opportunity you don't want to miss.

Why SSSSS is the Next Big Thing:

Meme Magic: We've seen various animals in memes, but a snake with a hat? That's the kind of originality that captures the internet's imagination. SSSSS is here to redefine what a memecoin can be.

Solana's Speed: With Solana's lightning-fast transactions, SSSSS trades will be quick, smooth, and barely noticeable until it's too late to catch up!

Community Over Everything: We're not just building a token; we're creating a tribe. A community that's as tight-knit as a snake in a cozy hat.

Bullish Indicators for SSSSS:

Momentum: The buzz around SSSSS is palpable. From crypto influencers to everyday enthusiasts, everyone's talking about this snake. Memes are spreading like wildfire, and with each tweet, the hype grows!

Innovative Roadmap: We're not just sitting on our tails. Expect staking rewards, exclusive SSSSS NFTs, and gaming integrations that'll make holding SSSSS more than just a speculative play.

Market Readiness: Solana's ecosystem is ripe for the next memecoin explosion. With less congestion and more opportunity, SSSSS  is positioned to be that breakout star.

Check Out These Numbers:

Price Action: Keep your eyes peeled for SSSSS's price chart. It's only the beginning of the ascent.

Market Cap: Starting from a modest base but with the potential to expand rapidly.

Community Growth: Every day, more people are donning their metaphorical snake hats and joining the rally.

What's Coming Up?

Airdrop Events: Regular airdrops to keep the community engaged and rewarded.

Staking Opportunities: Earn while you chill. Staking SSSSS means your snake works while you sleep, growing your nest egg.

Merch and More: From hats to hoodies, show your SSSSS pride with exclusive merch. And let's not forget about those unique NFTs!"
CryptoMoonShots,Swisstronik: A Promising Solution to Blockchain’s Scalability and Privacy Challenges,Rexythesol,4,1739681962.0,"Blockchain technology has revolutionized multiple industries, offering decentralized solutions for finance, supply chain management, and data security. However, despite its rapid growth, fundamental challenges such as scalability and privacy remain barriers to mainstream adoption. Swisstronik, an emerging blockchain project, aims to address these issues by leveraging zero knowledge proof (ZK proof) technology.

# The Role of Zero Knowledge Proofs in Blockchain

Zero knowledge proofs are cryptographic techniques that allow one party to prove the truth of a statement without revealing the underlying data. This is a game changer for blockchain privacy, as it enables transactions to be verified without exposing sensitive details. By incorporating ZK proof technology, Swisstronik ensures that user data remains private while still complying with verification requirements.

Beyond privacy, ZK proofs contribute to scalability by reducing the amount of data that nodes need to process. Traditional blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggle with transaction speed and high fees due to their reliance on full transaction verification. Swisstronik’s use of ZK proofs can optimize network efficiency, leading to faster and more cost effective transactions.

# Privacy and Compliance: A Crucial Balance

With increasing regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry, Swisstronik’s focus on privacy is particularly timely. Regulatory frameworks like the European Union’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) require blockchain projects to balance security and compliance. By implementing advanced privacy mechanisms, Swisstronik could offer a solution that satisfies both users’ need for confidentiality and regulators’ demands for transparency.

# Seamless Integration with Existing Ecosystems

Another advantage of Swisstronik is its compatibility with established blockchain networks. Instead of requiring developers to build entirely new infrastructure, Swisstronik can integrate with existing platforms, making adoption more feasible. This interoperability lowers entry barriers for businesses and developers, increasing its potential for widespread use.

# Conclusion

Swisstronik presents a compelling approach to solving blockchain’s privacy and scalability challenges. While its success remains to be proven, its innovative use of ZK proof technology positions it as a strong contender in the next evolution of blockchain. If Swisstronik delivers on its promises, it could play a crucial role in shaping the future of decentralized technology.

CryptoMoonShots,Enjoy the Ride – $POWSCHE Isn’t Just Another Pump & Dump,fegadi,1,1739660899.0,"
One of the biggest mistakes people make in crypto is rushing things. Always looking for the next 100x overnight, jumping from one project to another, chasing hype instead of substance. And sure, sometimes it works for a moment. But then? You’re left holding the bag, watching the next trend take off while you scramble to find another quick win.

$POWSCHE isn’t built for that. It’s not some random, fleeting token that lives and dies by the daily pump. It’s a movement. A project with depth, culture, and a mission that extends far beyond just numbers on a screen. And that’s why, if you’re here expecting an instant moonshot, you might be looking at it the wrong way.

The truth is, great things take time. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is a legacy. When you’re part of something real something with a strong foundation, an engaged community, and actual plans in motion you don’t need to stress about every dip or pump. You just need to enjoy the ride.

Think about it. POWSCHE has already done what most projects can only dream of. A community that stands strong through cycles, real-world rewards like Dubai trips and Porsche giveaways, and now, a multichain expansion that puts us in front of a massive new audience. We’re not just another “hope and pray” token. We deliver. Always.

So the question is, are you here for the long haul, or are you just looking for a quick flip? Because history shows that the biggest winners in crypto are the ones who see beyond the short term. The ones who plant their flag early, who understand the vision, who recognize that the real wealth isn’t just in the destination it’s in the journey.

And that’s exactly what we’re on right now. A journey that’s only getting started.

POWSCHE ALWAYS WINS."

CryptoMoonShots,$SPU - the memecoin you DIDN’T see coming - but won’t be able to ignore,Active-Party-8597,125,1739561761.0,"Months ago, I was scrolling through Reddit, drowning in **the same sh\*t over and over**.

* Animal coins
* Trump coins
* Seasonal coins like christmas or soperbowl
* And thousands of rugs and obvious scams

I was **this close** to quitting memecoins forever. Then I found something different.

 

# A TOKEN THAT ACTUALLY HAS A STORY

SPU isn’t another copy-paste dog token. It’s **the first memecoin built around an ACTUAL creative vision.**

* **The dev is DOXXED.** Not just some random anon, but a real artist who’s been working on this for **10 YEARS.**
* **Every character in SPU comes from his handmade sculptures**—crafted from computer scrap, then brought to life in animation. 
* **This isn’t just a token—it’s an animated universe.** TikTok clips are dropping, **YouTube is catching on, and Twitter degens are starting to notice.**
* Everything is based on **organic community growth,** real relationships and real community. No hype, no paid ads. 

I watched the first SPU video, and instead of feeling like I was getting scammed (again), I laughed my ass off. This was **actually fun**.

The power of a **good meme** beats any roadmap, any utility, any influencer.

SPU gets this — except it’s taking it to the **next level**.

✔ **FULLY ORIGINAL IP** – Not a ripoff, **100% unique content**  
✔ **Real art + Cartoons + Meme Energy** – A fusion that’s never been done before  
✔ **COMMUNITY-DRIVEN** – Regular VCs, no insider pump-and-dump sh\*t

 

# Take your chance now

Now you can choose between beeing on the sidelines **watching SPU go viral** and holding some sh\*tcoin that going to zero**.** 

Or you can take the unique opportunity of the current market. While all other projects fall, SPU has held the floor for 2 weeks. Still a very small market cap at around 200k.

Social media platforms and websites silence voices through automated AI moderation. These AI systems are controlled by centralized corporations with no transparency. Big Tech decides what stays and what gets removed, and users have no say in the process.

This is where $AVENCE comes in.

The Solution: AI + Blockchain for Fair & Transparent Moderation

$AVENCE is the first decentralized AI-powered moderation system built entirely on the blockchain. Unlike traditional AI filters that operate in secrecy, Avence brings full transparency and on-chain accountability to content moderation.

Key Features
	•	AI-driven filtering – Detects and removes harmful content in real time.
	•	Blockchain-backed transparency – Every decision is logged on-chain for public verification.
	•	Decentralized review system – Users can challenge AI decisions using governance tokens.
	•	Early adopters = Future whales – The token is still at a micro market cap with high upside potential.

Why $AVENCE Has 100x Potential

The AI market is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. The biggest challenge in AI adoption? Trust and fairness in its decision-making. Governments and businesses need decentralized solutions to ensure ethical AI implementation.

$AVENCE is positioned at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and regulation compliance. Its goal? To become the industry standard for trustless AI content moderation.

Market Potential
	•	Low market cap – Still in early stages, high growth potential.
	•	AI + Blockchain – The strongest narrative in crypto today.
	•	Growing regulatory demand – More companies and governments want transparent AI moderation tools.

Why Buy Now?
	•	Early buyers shape the ecosystem.
	•	Market cap is still under the radar.
	•	Once institutions enter, it’s too late to be early.

More recently, TSTBSC, originally launched as a mere test token, shattered expectations by gaining massive popularity and delivering surprising returns.   
  
This recurring cycle underscores that memecoins are far more than a passing trend—they’re a full-fledged movement.The latest token generating traction is BROCCOLI, which has captured attention and is already listed on major platforms like Bitget. But what’s driving this explosive rise? The answer is as surprising as it is captivating the name of CZ’s dog.  
  
it stands as yet another example of how fast trends shift in the Crypto space. Whether it will endure over the long hype is uncertain, but for now, it embodies the wild, unpredictable, and exhilarating essence of the memecoin ecosystem looks like we are awaking BSC chain with meme.

\*\*\*\*\*\* Reddit exclusive Air Drop \*\*\*\*\*\*

**Real Nuke Coin White Paper**

**Introduction:** What is Nuke Coin? Nuke Coin is the brain child of a small group of friends who enjoy the science of Nuclear Technology and Weapons. Nuke Coin is a token on the Solana Network. Have you ever looked into meme coins on DEXScreener? The market is full of rug pulls and scams. This brings us to one of our main goals for Nuke Coin: provide a token that shows the validity of Solana as a leading crypto platform.  Cryptocurrency gives power to the people and not mega entities and Solana has the potential to expand into the cultural zeitgeist in ways that other platforms have not.

Which brings us to Nuke Coin. We are striving for a community-oriented ecosystem where we can educate citizens of the world on nuclear weapons in a way that brings humor to a dark subject. We are politically neutral and do not support any candidates. Utility wise, this token is useless. This is our first project and we intend to support it as long as the world keeps it alive. In a perfect world, this would mean that our token becomes wildly successful enabling us to assign utility, enable staking and keep this project moving!

**Utility:** We understand that tokens, or “memecoins” do not have utility by default. With all crypto, the true value is in what the holders say it is worth. Our vision is to have Nuke Coin serve as a humorous payment method via Solana. Real friends send nuclear weapons to each other and to quote Tyler Durden, "" If you could Nuke anyone, who would you Nuke?"". Owe a friend $20? Nuke their wallet with Nuke Coin! Coworker annoying you about the $2s you owe them for a soda? Send them Nuke Coin and leave their wallet smoking and irradiated!

**Nuke Coin Tokenomics:**

Minted: 10B Tokens

**12%** \- Unknown ICBM has entered our air space. Please seek immediate shelter. (Pre-Sale Air Drops)

Airdrop to 12 random addresses (available to trade, sell at launch)

**15%** Presale advantage to market price – **unsold are burned** (poisoned via radioactive fallout) - Price is a derivative of the year Enrico Fermi built his Pile Reactor!

**20%** – Available for purchase/sell on launch

**12%** \- SLBM Trident II Launch Detected - MIRV Second Strike airdrop to 12 random addresses (MIRV fired 72 hours after launch)

**40%** Nuclear Submarine Movement Detected. 20% of this is vest for two weeks. The other 20% belongs to the Devs.

There are three of us and the divide will be:

·         Dev 1: 10%

·         Dev 2: 5%

·         Dev 3: 5%

 

What about the other 20%?

Nuke Coin is first and foremost a community project. The remaining 20% belongs to the community and will be given away in the form of air drops and other giveaways. **This amount is vested in the Community Wallet.**

 **About the 40%:** We understand the visuals of withholding 40% of the token. However, investigation into how to maintain “control” of a project during the first few weeks of launch with other tokens showed that to prevent rug pulls/snipe/bots a majority of the token must be spoken for. Some communities actually recommended retaining 80% of the tokens for two weeks to combat this and obfuscating this from the community via multi wallets, but that sounds even worse. We are a project of integrity and at the end of the day this is meant to be fun. Destroying the trust we manage to gain is not something we're interested in. The 40% is our attempt to ride the launch and listings on Dexs without crashing out or suffering LP drain. The three devs do own 20% of the project collectively, but the other 80% belongs to the community. Whether that is through buying, trading or receiving air drops (of which there will be many!).

 Keep your eyes on the skies and see you at launch!

 \-Criticality and the Nuke Coin Team.

 

Roadmap:

Q2-4 2025 – Continue Air Strikes to community to keep project interest up. Keep producing promos and content on YT and X.

CryptoMoonShots,The Next Big Thing: REAL Competitive Trading - $RED vs $BLUE,ILikeWeirdHumans,1,1739630003.0,"Memecoin cults are all the rage on Crypto Twitter right now. But why settle for just one when you can have two?

## The Basics

- **Two Tokens:** Choose your favorite—$RED or $BLUE. When the supply of your token hits zero, your side takes the victory and the rewards!
- **Dynamic HP System:** Each token starts with 10B HP (its supply), which can increase to 21B. Every purchase chips away at your rival’s HP while boosting your own.
- **GameMaster in Control:** A smart contract handles it all autonomously—dynamic pricing, ETH redistribution, and price updates based on Uniswap pools for extra strategy.

## What’s in It for You?

- **Community-Driven Rewards:** 70% of every purchase fuels the final reward pool, which returns to the community (unlike other projects who take 80% for themselves 👀).
- **Winner Takes All:** If your token wins, you get a share of the reward pool based on how much you hold. Own 1% of the supply? You’ll take 1% of the prize pool.
- **No Shady Business:** Liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced, and there are no insider wallets or token allocation. 

## More Green Flags?

- Total transparency. No rugs. Ownership renounced for ultimate peace of mind. If you any questions, I'll answer personally.
- Zero trading fees, just a 5% dev fee on GameMaster buys.
- This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s a tactical war where timing and strategy count.

## Ready to Pick a Side?

1️⃣ Head over to [redvblue.xyz](https://redvblue.xyz)
2️⃣ Buy* your favorite token, $RED or $BLUE 
3️⃣ Track HP live, shill your cult, and fight for glory
4️⃣ Stay updated on [X/Twitter](http://x.com/0xREDvBLUE) and [r/REDvBLUExyz](http://reddit.com/r/REDvBLUExyz)


*Tokens can also be traded on Uniswap, qualifying for rewards and influencing price but without increasing/decreasing HP ([$RED](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?chain=base&inputCurrency=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006&outputCurrency=0x28e9dD5cFB53B5C44FF1F5e06AC051551a871d48), [$BLUE](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?chain=base&inputCurrency=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006&outputCurrency=0x27211bFa5A7337f0C79617b33DeAFc8fA7C1eF6B))."

Some features i mostly look out for before i choose any of these tokens to trade include;

I lookout for bitget score on the token since the high score can indicate a good investment opportunity. This scores is determine using metrics like market trends, community sentiment, and performance. Next i need to check the community support since community is the major driver for meme coin's success. Ii mostly track this activities using platforms like Telegram, Discord, or X. The last features i mostly check is the whether the project has enough liquidity to ensure i withdraw my earnings. 

Bitget Seed is an innovative on-chain trading feature designed to help users discover high-potential, early-stage Web3 projects, including meme coins. It uses advanced AI algorithms to identify promising tokens that gives users best chances of aping the next 100x gem.

CryptoMoonShots,How attractive are AI related projects to crypto investors?,minibuddy0,1,1739612799.0,"In the last couple years one of the fastest growing niche in crypto, is the AI space, there's been a lot of new developments and exposure for so many AI related projects. 

The question now is how this benefits users in the web3 space or if it even benefits us at all, if you look at it at the moment, a lot of big tech dominates AI development, and from what we know they keep, control, profits, and even centralize data

  
The direct effect of this is that creators, researchers, and even us users are left with limited ownership or rewards. 

In all of this, I think the good news is that there are many projects that have proposed and are offering solutions to issues like these. 

For example, because of how expensive building AI tools can be and the amount of technical knowledge required, you have projects like MyShell (SHELL) that lets anyone create AI agents, integrate APIs, and bring their AI ideas to life without needing massive resources.

  
Although to be fair, I only found out about this one this week, when my exchange announced the extra reward they are giving to people who trade it on Bitget. Initially, the examples I'd like to use are options like FET that enables autonomous AI agents to interact and transact without intermediaries, or even AGIX with its decentralised marketplace for AI services where developers can create, share, and monetize AI models.

All of these are examples of the solutions I was referring to, but do you think there's a market for them? Would you say crypto users are open to adding projects like these to their portfolio?"

CryptoMoonShots,RAMON: The Most Bullish Meme Launch of 2025 Is Coming to Solana,DesignerSwimming9221,576,1739469715.0,"The crypto world is about to be flipped on its head. RAMON ($RAMON), the most anticipated Solana-based meme coin of the year, is launching on Tuesday, February 11th, backed by an elite network of top-tier investors, venture capitalists, 
and industry powerhouses.

A Movement, Not Just a Token

RAMON isn’t your typical meme coin - it’s a cultural phenomenon. Fueled by unfiltered chaos, relentless engagement, and raw exposure, RAMON is setting a new standard for Web3 communities. With an alter ego known as The Parasite, 
a fully autonomous AI agent, RAMON will call out crypto frauds, disrupt narratives, and inject pure, unfiltered entertainment into the space.

Backing the movement is the Scum Board, an AI-driven accountability system that scrapes X (Twitter) for sentiment data, ranks projects based on their shady activities, and
automatically exposes them to the public. The Parasite, linked directly to the Scum Board, will take things a step further - trash-talking bad actors in real-time and keeping the ecosystem honest.

Heavyweight Backing & Tier 1 CEX Listings

RAMON is not just a meme - it’s a power move. The project has secured support from over 30 major investors, including leading venture capital firms, angel investors, and venture studios. 
In addition, RAMON has confirmed multiple centralized exchange (CEX) listings in the first week, including a Tier 1 CEX on Day 1.

Beyond the listings, RAMON has attracted a stacked roster of KOLs, with Tier 1, 2, and 3 influencers ready to amplify the movement. The project has also forged collaborations with Toby & Brent, and the team’s deep connections in the crypto space include backing from key figures involved in Popcat, Su Deng, SunDog and Chill Guy, some of the biggest memes in recent history.

The hype has already begun. RAMON recently hosted an exclusive 140ft yacht party in Dubai, bringing together some of the biggest names in the space. The backing to this project is massive and there are even celebrity endorsements lined up, though the team is keeping those names under wraps until launch.

Join the Ramon Familia

Community isn’t just an afterthought in RAMON—it’s the foundation. Inspired by classic mafia structures, RAMON introduces the Ramon Familia, an exclusive hierarchical ranking system that rewards the most dedicated members with perks, privileges, and
real-world value.

Ranks include:
- The Boss – Ramon himself, leading the family.
- Underboss & Consigliere – Core leadership overseeing operations.
- Captains & Soldiers – Community ambassadors and moderators ensuring engagement.
- Sicarios – The PvP hitmen of RAMON, driving narrative-fueled burn events.
- The Inner Circle – A private alpha group for RAMON whales, offering insider
opportunities and exclusive perks.

Every rank comes with exclusive merchandise, dynamic NFTs, private access, and community-driven incentives, making membership in the Ramon Familia a true badge of honor.


The Takeover Begins – Be Part of It

RAMON is not here to take part—it’s here to take over. With a bold, AI-driven social movement, relentless community engagement, and heavyweight industry backing, 
this launch is guaranteed to shake up the crypto world.

Don’t just watch from the sidelines—join the movement.

CryptoMoonShots,$PUG Presale heating up. Could this be the next 100x,CemYigit987,526,1739463238.0,"

Rich Pug: The Solana Memecoin with Real Utility and Casino Gaming

The memecoin landscape is evolving, and Rich Pug is leading the charge on Solana with real utility. Unlike other dog-themed tokens with no tangible value, Rich Pug is set to revolutionize the space by introducing over 250+ casino-based games, Staking and much more.

✅Not Just Another Meme Coin

While many memecoins ride the hype wave without substance, Rich Pug distinguishes itself through its casino-based gaming arena. Unlike projects such as Hamster Kombat or Notcoin, which rely on repetitive tap-to-earn mechanics, Rich Pug’s games will be real and interactive, catering to the growing demand for decentralized gaming experiences.

✅Presale and Price Predictions

The Rich Pug presale is already making waves. They successfully raised $72,000, and running in the second stage, it is currently priced at $0.011. With a projected launch price of $0.03, investors are eyeing potential massive gains, especially with the upcoming mega burning event, which could see over 40% of the total supply burned.

Given these factors and the increasing demand for utility-driven memecoins, speculations suggest that Rich Pug could reach anywhere between $1 to $3 during the peak bull run.

✅Competitive Edge and Community Strength

One of the most compelling aspects of Rich Pug is its recognition by top media houses, positioning it as a direct competitor to some of Solana’s leading memecoins, which are currently boasting multi-million-dollar market caps.

However, what truly sets Rich Pug apart is its slow and steady approach to community growth. With an engaged community of over 3,500 members, constant giveaways, and high levels of interaction, it is steadily building a loyal holder base. Unlike randomly trading memecoins on DEXs, Rich Pug provides a structured and promising investment opportunity for those looking for the next 100x gem.

✅The Pug Army: 50+ Ambassadors on a Mission

To amplify its reach, Rich Pug has onboarded over 50 ambassadors, forming a dedicated Pug Army committed to spreading the word about this high-utility memecoin. Their efforts are positioning Rich Pug as a formidable force in the Solana ecosystem.

CryptoMoonShots,"Swisstronik - RWA, AI, Crypto, and Web 3.0 compliance made easy",WhichRadio6124,3,1739559963.0,"Finding a balance between decentralization and legal compliance is one of the main challenges facing blockchain technology as it advances. Many promising projects are unable to be widely adopted because they cannot adhere to strict regulations while protecting user privacy. However, a new generation of hybrid blockchain solutions is beginning to emerge to address this issue and facilitate a seamless integration of compliance and decentralization. Swisstronik and other identity-based hybrid blockchain ecosystems represent a major advancement in this area. Know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance measures are integrated into the Swisstronik platform without endangering decentralization or revealing user data. Businesses can confidently develop decentralized apps (dApps) that respect global regulatory standards and uphold the core principles of blockchain technology by putting these safeguards in place.



Using cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) is one of the most exciting new developments in this area. These methods allow for the verification of user credentials without revealing personal data. These cryptographic solutions, which ensure the privacy of sensitive data while still adhering to legal requirements, are revolutionizing compliance in blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, existing business structures can be easily integrated with hybrid blockchain solutions. Companies can use tools like on-chain identity verification and privacy-preserving data mechanisms to streamline operations and lower compliance costs. This eliminates one of the biggest barriers to adoption of Web 3.0 technologies for traditional industries.



As businesses recognize the potential of decentralized applications and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, there will only be a greater need for privacy-focused, compliant blockchain solutions. Projects can bridge the gap between the Web 3.0 ecosystem and conventional industries by proactively addressing regulatory complexities while maintaining security and decentralization.



To shape the future of a decentralized and compliant digital economy, developers, investors, and companies will need to keep an eye on Swisstronik's innovative blockchain projects.

Buy your sweetheart a pile of our coins and they will reward you with kisses (or more).  

This may be the only time that you can tell your partner, “Hey babe, you’re a whale”, without getting slapped.

Roses will fade, but $CHRCH will grow and prosper.

CryptoMoonShots,CZ's Dog Perry – The Next Meme Coin Moonshot?,Difficult_Wear6902,565,1739454618.0,"The crypto space has witnessed countless meme coins rise and fall, but every once in a while, one project stands out from the rest. Enter CZ's Dog Perry ($PERRY) – a fresh new meme coin inspired by Binance’s legendary leader, CZ, and his fictional loyal dog, Perry.

What Makes Perry Special?
Unlike the endless wave of low-effort meme tokens, $PERRY aims to bring community-driven innovation to the meme coin space. Built on a solid foundation, Perry isn’t just another copy-paste token but a project with real potential.

Key Features:

Strong Narrative: Inspired by the legendary figure CZ, Perry embodies the resilience and vision of the crypto community.
Fair Launch: No presale, no team tokens – pure community ownership.
Hyper-Deflationary Mechanism: A portion of every transaction is burned, making $PERRY scarcer over time.
Vibrant Community: Active engagement and marketing campaigns to drive organic growth.
Why $PERRY Could Be the Next Big Meme Coin
With meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu achieving billion-dollar market caps, there’s always room for the next viral sensation. $PERRY has the branding, community, and hype potential to follow in their footsteps.

How to Get In Early
$PERRY is currently trading on [insert exchange or contract address], and early holders could benefit from the token’s growth as more investors take notice. The team is actively pushing marketing, partnerships, and exchange listings to ensure a strong trajectory.

Final Thoughts
Meme coins are all about narrative, community, and momentum. CZ’s Dog Perry checks all the boxes for a moonshot candidate. Whether you’re a degen trader or a long-term holder, keeping an eye on $PERRY might be a smart move.

What do you think? Could $PERRY be the next 100x gem? Let’s discuss!

CryptoMoonShots,THC - Tin Foil Community: The latest memecoin rugpull masterclass - Let's discuss :-),Living_Experience_31,4,1739545395.0,"Alright lads and lasses, gather round for a cautionary tale from the depths of the memecoin trenches. Before we dive in, let’s get one thing straight—this isn’t FUD against the community takeover. If anything, some of you poor sods might actually be able to turn this disaster into something real. If you can resurrect this from the ashes, fair play! But before we celebrate, we need to talk about how we got here in the first place. Understanding these scams is the only way we can stop history from repeating itself. Because let's be honest—THC isn’t the first, and it sure as hell won’t be the last.

Also, full disclosure—I didn’t invest in this myself. I was just watching from the sidelines, popcorn in hand, as the chaos unfolded. It was like witnessing a crypto-themed episode of *Black Mirror* in real-time.

# The Build-Up

It all started with the classic shilling in every crypto subreddit you can imagine. ""New community token!"" ""Get in early!"" ""This is the next 1000x!""—you know the drill. They had a website, a Twitter, a Telegram, the whole shebang. And what was the call to action? ""Join our Telegram to find out more!""

Ah yes, the Telegram—where the magic happens. Or, in this case, where the bots and paid shills gather like a swarm of overly enthusiastic NPCs in an MMO. Sure, there were probably a few real degens in there, but the whole thing reeked of a setup. The way they hyped it, you'd think it was the second coming of Doge himself.

# The Launch

At around 7:30 PM UTC, the CA was released, and from there, it was pure entertainment. Market cap shot up and down like a malfunctioning elevator. But within hours, the inevitable happened: multiple rug pulls.

Turns out, 30% of the supply was owned by the token launchers. *Shocker!* So, in the grand tradition of professional crypto heists, they dumped on the buyers, draining liquidity faster than a Brit downs a pint on a Friday night. It was like watching a train crash in slow motion—horrifying, yet you couldn’t look away.

And who were these masterminds behind the rug? Who knows! Could be some faceless group of Indian or Nigerian scammers running a Telegram farm, some greasy teenagers operating from their mum’s basement, or some middle-aged bloke in a tracksuit living in Dubai off his previous rug-pull winnings. Either way, they were pros at the game.

The result? A peak MC of $1.6 million absolutely obliterated down to around $157k. And yet, people are still bag-holding, praying for a comeback. Bless 'em. The copium levels are off the charts.

# Lessons to Take Away

1. **New launches are a minefield** – If you’re new to crypto, don’t just FOMO in because some Telegram mod says “we go to Valhalla.” Let the hype die down before making a move. Or if you must ape in, grab a tiny bag and DCA instead of going all-in. Or, y’know, just set your money on fire—it’s quicker.
2. **Study the scammers** – The THC team are **pros** at this. If you want to avoid getting rekt, analyse how these scams operate. They follow the same patterns over and over again. It’s basically a Ponzi speedrun.
3. **Look at token distribution** – If one wallet holds a ridiculous percentage, run. Coins like THC make it painfully obvious who’s gonna rug you. If 30% of the supply is in one wallet, you’re not “early,” you’re dinner.
4. **Established memecoins with real communities are your best bet** – Not shilling, but if you’ve been around, you’ve probably seen Powsche mentioned everywhere. Their OG dev is still around, their token distribution isn’t a joke, and their community is actually active across multiple platforms. Contrast that with THC, where the only development was the founders learning how fast they could empty the liquidity pool.
5. **Real projects build, scams don’t** – Powsche, for example, has sent community members to Dubai, given away a Porsche, and even developed a bridge from Solana to Ethereum. THC, on the other hand, built nothing except broken dreams and empty bags. Powsche is around 11 months old now, it's had its ups and downs but the community is second to none.
6. **Plath and Pyrate also seem like real communities** – Again, DYOR, but these are looking much more promising than the next shady rug launch.

# Final Thoughts (Not FUD, Just Facts)

Again, this isn’t about FUDding the community takeover—if anything, that might be the only way for some of you to claw back your losses. Who knows? Maybe you’ll even turn it into something legit. But we have to talk about these scammers so we can all get better at spotting them before they rinse the next batch of newcomers.

I didn’t invest in THC myself, but watching it unfold was like binge-watching a true crime documentary in real-time. Time and time again, I see fresh-faced investors ape into these ""next big things,"" only to get rekt and then have to CTO (Cut Their Losses) just to recover. The same ones who once shouted “jeets will be punished!” end up becoming jeets themselves because they have no other choice. It’s the circle of life, but with more financial ruin.

So, do your own research, avoid obvious scams, and don’t get seduced by Telegram hype. And for the love of all things holy, if a token looks like a scam, smells like a scam, and acts like a scam—it’s probably a scam.

Stay safe out there, degens. And as always, cheers for reading!"

CryptoCurrencies,"Change my mind, Polkadots JAM upgrade is the greatest invention in web3 since smart-contracts",bitcoinovercash,3,1738890505.0,"

Yes price action is bad. But I’m talking technology.

Upgrades overview:
—> JAM can host and execute any and all contract-languages (Move, Plutos, EVM, Rust…) all of them 
—> JAM can verify transactions in parallel and they are actually verified on-chain, not off-chain in an L2
—> transaction latency within cores will be 5-50ms
—> JAM can dynamically scale up or down a smart-contract or blockchains computation resources, based on its real time demand
—> JAM uses highly programmable JAM services that can host things outside of just smart-contract languages and entire blockchains. It can run the entire chatGPT AI model, python scripts, C++

Upgrade Summary:
Instead of trying to make one blockchain faster, JAM works by running multiple processing units (“cores”) that execute transactions in parallel. And these cores are all fully on-chain not some off-chain L2 or Hydra-Head roll up. This means no congestion, near-instant execution (~5-50ms), and automatic scaling whenever demand increases—just like cloud computing. 

Unlike Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano, which all hit bottlenecks when too many people use them, JAM simply adds more power as needed, making it infinitely scalable.

Can someone else review and see what conclusion you come to? I don't want to create FUD unnecessarily, it would be odd for them to realize such high losses. Maybe they are transferring to another wallet?

It does appear there are a lot of transactions to Coinbase. Are they moving everything to another wallet? There are so many small and large dollar transactions that its very hard to follow. Millions sent to an address, just to be sent to another, and another and another and appears to end up in a whale Coinbase account? Are they distributing coins to themselves?

I'm actually completely new to this. I'm still learning, but I started getting a couple of good trades in a row (not in this though).

Instead of pulling out early (nice) I left it and waited for it to change direction, only for it to not happen and then my account got liquidated.

Instead of ending it there, I funded the account again, got like 2 good trades in a row and proceeded to liquidate the account again from doing the exact same thing as above.

I'm not here to hope for pity, I just need people to tell, and, hopefully, advice too. I feel like this is good, there is no better teacher than experience, especially when it's yours.

I got all my wallets created, security phrases stored properly, got BullX going, watched some videos once more to refresh my mind, and decided it was time to purchase some SOL and go to work. 

  
I purchase SOL and get it on my Phantom wallet. I do a small test transfer from Phantom wallet to BullX wallet (SOL) - SUCCESSFUL. Okay, perfect. Lets do this one more time, but with enough money to get my feet wet for the night. Same process - just copy and paste the wallet link from BullX into Phantom and send my SOL. SUCCESSFUL. I check refresh BullX - nothing. I refresh a few times. Nope. I take a break hoping if I give it a few minutes, considering how weird SOL has been, then hopefully it will show up soon. 

  
TWO HOURS LATER and still nothing. I begin to look into forums, joined live streams, googling - there is nothing on this really. The only thing I got was about a dozen scammers trying to get me to click on their website to resolve the issue. Ok, I began to investigate the transaction details on Solscan. I compared the previous successful transaction to the second transaction.. after several minutes I finally found the issue. 

  
SOME HOW one capitalized letter became lower case.......... how tf does this happen when copying/ pasting the link from wallet to wallet.

The latest deposit was returned back to my PayPal even though I delivered the PayPal transaction statement which I've done since 2021 and now my PayPal says that my account has ""suspicious activity"" and is locked until I give them a bank statement from the OpenPayd Finl Services Malta Ltd bank account.

1. is it more profitable to sell on the app or the exchange?

2. Is it more profitable to buy on the app or exchange?

Crypto_com,Why Crypto.com have the worst User interface ?,KiLL_Shott,1,1739468859.0,I really wanted to try [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) because of high fees in Coinbase and worst maintenance problem in kraken but man [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) give me headache. Its more of advertising app then exchange and talking about ease for user is no where in app or in browser you cant see your position in same page where you looking at coin so if you have to cancel or change you can easily do it. And why why you guys dont provide a proper chart system in your app and browser? I am guessing whoever designing this app have problem understanding about user interface should be easy for user and not complicated specially in Crypto world where things move fast/volatile. Bottom line fix the darn app and give us chart system like all the other exchanges.

I now live in Geneva and I have to enter all the OpenPayd details every time which is annoying as the UBS Banking does not save the banking details, or is there a way to save the bank details for transfers?

Secondly I lose a small percentage with a bank transfer fee from UBS then I also lose more with the conversion rate from CHF to EUR when loading money onto the card. 

Then when I spend EUR in Geneva where I live I loose even more on the conversion rate from EUR back to CHF when I want to go shopping 

I'm so used to Australia where I only enter reference code in my banking app and a instant zero few transfer and no conversion rate when spending. 

Am I'm missing something, what's the best way to top up and use the cryptocom debit card in Switzerland with out all these small loses eating into everything?

Crypto_com,POTENTIAL LAWSUIT AGAINST CRYPTO_COM: Cypro_com Visa Card Charged More Than What I Paid To The Merchant,annk4131215,0,1739480493.0,"I went to a restaurant (which does not accept gratuity and tips since it is like a fast-food restaurant. I paid $17.00 CAD for food. I used my Crypto\_com Ruby Steel Visa Card, which was added to my Apple Pay. 

I have attached images; as you can see, the receipt says $17.00 CAD and Apple Pay shows I paid $17.00 CAD. Also, this restaurant doesn't require a tip or a signature. Whatever you pay at the cashier is the final bill, and that final amount is authorized already.

When I logged in to the Crypto\_com app, the transaction showed $20.40 CAD (precisely 20% more than the initial authorized amount of $17.00). I contacted Crypto\_com support on the app. They told me to contact the merchant. I was already eating food at the restaurant, so I went to the cashier and asked them if they would charge me extra. He said, **""No, we did not charge the above amount; we only charged you $17.00, and $17.00 CAD was authorized.""** The merchant showed me the receipt, and I have attached the image of the receipt below.

Crypto\_com's customer support said that the merchant authorized an extra amount. Still, the merchant says they did not. So either Crypto\_com authorized an extra amount without my authorization, or Crypto\_com's partner bank in Canada, *Digital Commerce Bank (DCBank)*, authorized a higher amount in the transaction without my authorization.

I found an article on the Crypto\_com website; the link is below:

https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/4283259-what-are-the-charges-fees-and-limits-associated-with-the-crypto-com-visa-card

However, since the merchant is not authorizing a higher amount, this could lead to a class action lawsuit against Crypto\_com, *Digital Commerce Bank (DCBank)*, or both. If you are experiencing the same problem, please write your story version and upload receipts and transaction confirmations under this thread.

Crypto_com,Noted Cronos Price Differences - Crypto.com vs. Others,JTBoner1,1,1739381788.0,"Hello all,

 

Just wanted to pass the message onto the community that this morning I noticed that Crypto.com actually charges more for their Cronos (CRO) Token on their platform than the others. The price of Crypto.com was generally $0.002 to $0.004 CAD higher than other platforms like Coinbase and CoinMarketCap.

 

Later I noticed that this actually happens to many other tokens sold on their platform and it seems like some shady business is happening by taking advantage of a lack of attention to detail. With the millions of transactions occurring on a daily basis, this most likely equates to tens of millions of dollars a year getting skimmed from people by fractionally raising the price.  Has anyone else noticed this discrepancy yet or is it just me?"
Crypto_com,Unresolved issue regarding Magaverse coin retrieval and refund request,SignificantMark6376,1,1739368213.0,"On January 8th, I purchased Magaverse Coin at a low price using the Phantom app. That same day, I mistakenly transferred the entire amount to [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/), believing the token was supported on the platform. This was based on a Magaverse price chart I found on Google on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) website. I take full responsibility for this misunderstanding.

Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately contacted support, and I was informed that I needed to pay 100 USC (\~$150 CAD) for the retrieval of my funds. I made this payment in good faith, expecting a resolution. However, despite multiple follow-ups throughout January, I never received any updates or access to my coins.

On January 16th, Magaverse reached its all-time high, yet I was unable to access my funds because [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) never completed the retrieval. As the value started to drop, I still had no control over my assets, despite waiting for weeks. When it became clear that the retrieval was pointless due to the complete loss of value, I contacted support again on January 24th, requesting a refund of the retrieval fee.

Since January 24th until today, February 12th, I have received no response and no resolution to this matter. Given that I had no access or control over my funds due to Crypto.com's failure to process the retrieval, I am requesting a full refund of the retrieval fee (100 USC / \~$150 CAD) and a reimbursement of the amount I originally invested in Magaverse, as I was prevented from managing my funds due to Crypto.com’s inaction.

This issue has remained unresolved for over a month, which is completely unacceptable."

CryptoIndia,Buy/Sell on Karsa P2P as an Early User,stablecoindev,0,1738874645.0,"Hi r/CryptoIndia! I'm Shahryar, the founder of [Karsa](https://gokarsa.com): we’re a YC-funded, secure P2P exchange, focused on dollar access for everyday people in regions like India. We just launched last week and would love to have the community come onboard to trade P2P on our platform (*+ we have a bonus program specifically for you all!*)

**Why Karsa**

* Most exchanges focus only on traders, while many legitimate businesses and professionals in India struggle to access USD efficiently. Our users include folks in fintech, startup founders, and businesses who need stablecoins to hold or move money—not just traders—this is a much safer set of buyers, with significantly less risk of fraud.
* Security is our absolute priority. Unlike larger exchanges that optimize for user numbers, we’ve personally verified (and spoken with) every buyer and seller on our platform. We’d rather have fewer buyers/sellers that feel safe doing more volume than letting everyone in. We can never 100% mitigate fraud risks, but we’re putting higher safeguards than any other platform.
* We use smart contracts for escrow, and we handle all payment verification / disputes directly with you - no need to manage any individual chats with buyers.

**Coming Soon**

We're expanding rapidly with features focused on practical usage:

* Card services for spending and easy off-ramping
* Virtual US bank accounts for sending/receiving payments and faster/cheaper freelancer payouts
* Access to US Treasury yields for your stablecoin holdings
* Currently only available on web but mobile app on the way soon

**Bonus Program for Early Adopters**

***We're currently running a bonus program for sellers joining our platform—reach out to me for more details.*** I'm personally available to walk anyone through our onboarding process and help you get set up - whether you're interested in buying or selling (you can get started at https://gokarsa.com/deposit). Feel free to reach out to me on telegram (sherooberoo) or on Whatsapp at +18178810943 with any questions, issues, feedback, etc."
CryptoIndia,Questions regarding crypto tax and Binance transaction statement,clueless_robot,4,1739689373.0,"Now that Binance is FIU registered, I decided to go file my crypto transactions. I have a few questions.

1) Can I just file for this financial year i.e. 2024-2025? Or do I have to go back and file for past years and pay any penalty (if any)? Can the past years be forgiven? If past years need to be filed, how far into the past do I need to go?

2) I downloaded a comprehensive transaction statement from Binance. Do I just give this to my CA to figure things out or would I have to do math by myself? I've used futures, simple earn and multiple such products. I've even sent small amounts to the Web3 wallet in the Binance ecosystem.

3) ClearTax has a tool where you just upload the CSV and they do everything for you. Has anyone used it and is it reliable and accurate?

CryptoIndia,Question on Crypto Mining in India and tax Implications,Realistic-Bath-761,8,1739632679.0,"Hello All,

A group of us are exploring setting up mining rigs (ASIC based) that are capable of unto 60GH/s to mine a collection of Alt coins that can later be converted to BTC. We plan to setup solar power uptown 40KW. We do however have some questions on taxation in India. Understand that mining itself is still legal . Here are the questions

1. When the mined alt coins are swapped for BTC is there a tax needs to be paid to the government.

2. If answer to 1 is no, then when the BTC is transferred to our wallet in CoinDCX, the Indian government (under current law) considers mined BTC Fair Market Value as  Zero, and the tax (30%) will be on the total value of the bitcoin. Does the government allow cost of acquisition of such Bitcoin to be offset (cost of the miner Rigs, solar installation depreciation or electricity costs). 

3. Has anyone actually setup mining farms in India with solar power and based on their experience after taxes does it make sense to mine in India

  
We may also look at opportunity to setup the mining in other country if it is not profitable in India but then transferring the bitcoins to India and getting money out to bank gets a bit complicated.

  
Would appreciate your experienced comments"

CryptoIndia,Is Investing in Crypto in India a Smart Choice?,NecessaryGur9654,13,1739613145.0,"Is there anything favorable about investing in Crypto, particularly through Binance? First, you purchase USDT via P2P, where you typically lose around 5-10% due to margin fees. After that, you need to achieve a return on investment (ROI) that surpasses what you could earn from more stable alternatives like fixed deposits or mutual funds, all while considering the 30% tax on crypto profits. Additionally, any losses you incur can only be offset against your gains. Even if you manage to make a decent profit, converting that profit into cash isn’t straightforward; you’ll have to navigate the P2P route again. Here, you not only face seller margins but also the risk of your bank account being frozen or subjected to a lien if you receive funds deemed ""tainted"" from a seller. Moreover, declaring your earnings and dealing with potential inquiries from the tax authorities is a daunting prospect. I was beginning to take this investment seriously, but it’s becoming clear that there are significant drawbacks to investing in crypto in India."

CryptoIndia,My Take on WazirX Rebalancing & Fund Recovery! 🚀,Some_Piece_8270,7,1739552116.0,"There’s been some buzz around WazirX’s rebalancing and fund recovery plan. I have tried to understand the rebalancing process and here’s what I’ve understood:

 **📊 An Example:**

Imagine you had ₹1,00,000 in your WazirX account on July 18, 2023. After the hack, WazirX can recover 85% of your tokens. That means your portfolio is worth ₹85,000 as of January 17, 2025 (the rebalancing date).

**But here’s the important part:** You’re not getting ₹85,000 in cash. You’ll get crypto tokens, and their value will depend on market prices when you’re paid, i.e., after the scheme is approved.

**Example of How It Works:**

1️⃣ Let’s say you hold 1 BTC. On Jan 17, 2025, BTC was ₹30 lakh. If by payout day, BTC jumps to ₹32 lakh, you’ll get BTC at that **higher price**, meaning your recovery amount increases with the market.

2️⃣ If there’s a **bull ru**n around payout time, your 85% recovery could even become 110% or more! 🚀📈 (Of course, it could go the other way if the market dips.)

**💡Bottom Line:**

You’re getting back 85% of your original portfolio in crypto, adjusted to the market price at payout.

💯**My Take:** I think this approach is fair and transparent. If we say YES to the Scheme, we can finally recover our funds and move forward. ✅🚀"

Zebpay charges are absurd. I had put 25K I had to withdraw XRP thrice seperately because the maximum withdrawal limit was $100 a day. Everytime I withdraw I need to pay a withdrawal fee of 1XRP. XRP is already marked up by 8-10% to begin with.

Mudrex keeps changing their banking partners every week. I put 1.35L on it and bought USDT after all deductions etc the USDT credited was 1.25L. if you need to withdraw from mudrex, you need to do some verification. I did it and it got rejected. Hence I'm not able to withdraw it to an external wallet. The only option that I have is to withdraw to my bank account where they deduct the 1% tds for no mistake of mine. I called up the customer Support and the person told me that I can hold it in my account and sell when the price goes higher for USDT. 🤦‍♂️ These people have no idea what they are doing.

This is why I really miss WazirX. They gave instant withdrawals atleast. Their integration with Binance was super smooth.

Cryptozoology,Would the Supergiant Goblin Sharks from the Gulf of Mexico be considered a type of cryptid?,Galactic_Idiot,472,1739577658.0,"Despite their extreme elusiveness, goblin sharks have been known to western science since 1898. And for over two centuries, these sharks were not known to exceed around 4 meters.

This all changed, though, on the 25th of July 2000, when an enormous, likely female goblin shark was hauled up by commercial fishermen off the gulf of mexico, having become entangled in the fishing line attached to one of their crab traps. The shark was likely already dead by the time it came to the surface; the crew had dissected the shark, and discarded all of its remains, except its jaws, which supposedly they still possess to this day. 

But this Goliath wasn't some one-time fluke; another huge, verified female goblin shark was captured off the southeast gulf, this time trapped in a trawling net, on the 19th of April 2014. Unlike the 2000 shark, this one was well alive when found. After taking a few pictures, it would be released by the fishermen, where it swam its way back down to the depths.

The sheer size of these goblin sharks cannot be understated; the upper estimates for both sharks has them at over 6 meters in length – behind only the basking and great white sharks as the longest lamniformes in the world. One paper from 2019 states that the maximum length of the 2000 shark may have been up to 7 meters; greater than even the longest verified great white sharks, though likely not nearly as massive (though when I read the paper, it seemed the 7m measurment was mentioned out of pocket, with no explanation or apparent citation. Unless I missed something in the paper, i don't think this size estimate should be taken too seriously).

One thing I think is important to note is that an exceptionally large, but not quite supergiant goblin shark was trawled off the coast of Taiwan on the 13th of June 2023. Unlike the supergiants, this shark was able to be properly studied, and was measured at 4.7 meters in length, making her the world’s largest goblin shark to be scientifically examined. It's likely that a major contributor in her exceptional size was due to being pregnant with a whopping six pups; however, when the 2000 fishing crew dissected the supergiant they had caught, they found she had an empty gut, and zero pups in her.

Perhaps what is most fascinating, though, is that goblin sharks of this size are not just known exclusively from the gulf of mexico, but these two sharks are also the only goblin sharks to ever be found in the gulf. This ushers a lot of speculation about the life history and affinities of these sharks:

Could these goblin sharks represent a population unique to at least the northern Gulf of Mexico? Could they perhaps be a completely new species of goblin shark? If they are a unique population/species, what other features, adaptations and behaviors (aside from size) might these sharks possess? What caused these goblin sharks to become so much larger than those found everywhere else in the world? What are the males of this goblin shark population like? Are they also uniquely large? 

And this is where the question of them being a possible cryptid comes in – because unfortunately, none of these questions can be answered. With scientists having been unable to observe either shark in the flesh, and none having been seen since for over a decade, these supergiant goblin sharks of the gulf of mexico have been complete enigmas, and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future. While nobody is contesting the validity of these sharks, the only thing that anyone has to even just verify their existence are the very few pictures taken of the two sharks. This is also why the size estimates for them are so “wide;” you can only get so precise with a few unprofessional photos.

But I'm no cryptozoologist. So I'm not sure whether the supergiant goblin sharks are true cryptids. But I suppose that's why I came here to ask yall about it. To anyone who read all this, thanks for your time :)

Cryptozoology,The link between the Eurasian wildmen and the color red,Mister_Ape_1,6,1739649464.0,"Until the late 20th century it was theorized the Eurasian wildmen were reluct Homo neanderthalensis. Others even thought they were Homo erectus.

But finding out we were able to reproduce with Neanderthals and Denisovans, and Denisovans were able to reproduce with Erectus, made a huge hole in this theory.

Now we know the only ones who could have survived are the very primitive ones such as Homo floresiensis and Paranthropus.

The others would have turned into a new ethnic human group with more introgression by the Neolithic or even earlier. And the more time passed, the least extra introgression they would have had, because everytime some Homo sapiens sapiens mixed with one of them, they would have introduced into themselves a bit more of us, and they would have lost a bit of their previous selves. And since if they still exist they still mix with the locals, then if they still had significant extra introgression, even the locals would have had some extra introgression themselves by mixing with the wildmen. We know it is not so.

This means the Eurasian wildmen of recent times have to be human, however some may not be just feral humans. A basic feral human is not ethnically distinct than local people, is just someone who was abandoned. They do not have a dustinct, hunter gathering culture, they are just hunans with no culture at all.

There is a reason to believe the Eurasian wildmen are more than mere feral humans. Sometimes they could have been some ancient ethnic groups who had to hide to survive the newcomers. Almasti from Caucasus, the wildman of Central Asia, Mongolian Almas and even the Yeren from Central China, (which in origin was human, then in the 20th century the name was used for a sudden appearence of brown bears in Shennongjia forest) all had dark skin and RED OR REDDISH BROWN hair. This is not a baseless idea because reddish or ""camel color"" is the hair color of DEAD BODIES, not only of bears or humans in bear pelts seen from a distance for a short while. Dead bodies do not run away and can be stripped from pelts if they wear them. Yet we have this...

Dead body 1

Gansu, 1940

We could see that the 'wildman' was already shot dead and laid on the roadside. The body was still supple and the stature very tall, approximately 2 metres. The whole body was covered with a coat of thick greyish-RED hair which was very dense and approximately onecunlong. Since it was lying face-down, the more inquisitive of the passengers turned the body over to have a better look. It turned out to be a mother with a large pair of breasts, the nipples being very red as if it had recently given birth. The hair on the face was shorter. The face was narrow with deep-set eyes, while the cheek bones and lips jutted out. The scalp hair was roughly one chi long and untidy.

Dead body 2

Mongolia, 1980

1980, a worker at an experimental agricultural station, operated by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences at Bulgan, encountered the dead body of a wildman: ""I approached and saw a hairy corpse of a robust humanlike creature dried and half-buried by sand. I had never seen such a humanlike being before covered by CAMEL COLOUR brownish-yellow short hairs and I recoiled, although in my native land in Sinkiang I had seen many dead men killed in battle .... The dead thing was not a bear or ape and at the same time it was not a man like Mongol or Kazakh or Chinese and Russian. The hairs of its head were longer than on its body"" (Shackley 1983, p. 107).

Dead body 3

Kabardino Balkaria, 1939

Armed with a stick, I turned it over on all sides and, sitting on my heels, I examined it closely. The head was enveloped in a whole mane of very long hair which, in the living state, probably reached to the waist. The hair was very tangled and matted with thistles. This mane was so thick that, when I turned the head, it remained in the air, as on a cushion. That is why I was not able to discern the form of the skull. However, its dimensions were those of a human skull. The forehead was receding. This spot is very prominent (points to the eyebrows). The nose is small and turned up. It had no root, and was as though pushed into the face. It was the nose of a monkey. The cheeks were prominent, like those of a Chinese. The lips were not those of a man. Rather, they were thin and straight, as in monkeys. I did not see the teeth, as the lips were pressed firmly together. The chin was not as in man, but was rounded and heavy. The ears were human; one was torn, the other intact. The eyes were strongly slanted, with the apertures directed downward and outward. I do not know the color of the eyes. The eyelids were closed, and I did not raise them. The skin was BLACK (this was from Caucasus, so he was mixed with African Ottoman escaped slaves, skin is actually brown not black elsewhere), and covered with dark REDDISH-brown hair. The hair was absent around the eyes and on the upper parts of the cheeks. The cheeks themselves and the ears were covered with short hair. On the neck and the chin the hair was longer.

Those people had to be in most of Eurasia as a large Paleolithic Eurasian group with a mix of African or Oceanian, West Eurasian and East Eurasian traits. But then, as the modern groups expanded after the Last Glacial Maximum, they were reduced in numbers and separated in small communities isolated on the mountains. So they gradually mixed with their respective culturally modern neighbors, but also retained common characteristics found in specimen from Caucasus to Mongolia if not even China and East Siberia.

A Mongolian Almas would likely plot the closer to a Mongolian rather than to a Caucasian Almasti, but the two wildmen would still have shared genes no other group would have from the Paleolithic group they descend from.

If this has to logically be a 95% human group, what is it like ? Which genetic populations originated it ? Caucasians, Central Asians and Mongols are 90% black haired and 9% brown haired, they have basically no red hair, and yet they are light skinned."

If you wanna act disrespectful, condescendant or sarcastic, just ignore this post.**



Hi dear cryptozoology enthusiasts, how are you ? Today I need your help finding more informations about an african cryptid called the ""Serpenti"".

Context : was reading one of my cryptozoology-related books titled ""Le bestiaire énigmatique de la cryptozoologie - Du Yéti au calamar géant"" by Benoît Grison (I dunno if there's an english languaged edition for this one). In his chapter dedicated to debunking african cryptids, he took a look at a cryptid located in the Guinea-Bissao (Bijagos, Formosa Island).

  
That cryptid would be called the ""Serpenti"" and would have been seen by a guide called Patrick Sébile several times in the 90s. It's described as very long (3.5 to 4 meters long) with a head like an otter. The animal was floating on its back, again like an otter, before diving. People in the region claimed to know the ""Serpenti"" too, and claimed it was not a manatee nor an african otter (*Aonyx capensis*). Some authors considered some sort of tropical seal.

  
That's all I have, and I cannot seem to find anything about the ""Serpenti"" on the internet. Very curious, especially when Benoît Grison ends his chapter by saying the cryptid is still seen by locals nowadays.

  
Did you hear about this one ? What are your thoughts ?"
Cryptozoology,Beebe's untouchable fish,Jonnyleeb2003,50,1739488951.0,"These in my opinion are some of the most plausible cryptids. In the 1930s, William Beebe went down in the ocean in a bathysphere and documented several fish. Out of all the fish he documented, 5 of them have never been confirmed to exist. One of them even appears to be a misidentified comb jellyfish. Another he described as a species of giant dragonfish. These are some of the most plausible cryptids in my opinion, because the ocean is a big place, but it does beg the question, why have these fish never been seen since? It's speculated they may have gone extinct since being documented by Beebe, meaning only 1 person saw these fish, before they went extinct. What are your thoughts?"
Cryptozoology,Could belemnites still be around? As another giant squid species.,Turbulent-Name-8349,21,1739500753.0,"Not really cryptozoology but, since people are asking about modern trilobites. What about modern belemnites?

""Belemnites are an extinct order of squid-like cephalopods that existed from the Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous, and possibly the Eocene."" Extremely common Mesozoic fossils. ""The largest belemnite known, would have measured up to 3.11 metres in total body length.""

Which brings us to the bigfin squid. Recently discovered, we can't even tell if the juveniles are a similar species to the adults, no adult has ever been captured. Total length  4 to 8 metres, with some estimates up to 12 metres (yes, you read that correctly) due to very long arms and tentacles. ""Uniquely among cephalopods, the arms and tentacles were of the same length and looked identical (similar to extinct belemnites)"".

(Caveat, the body is much shorter than the tentacles, weight is very much less than the giant squid)."
Cryptozoology,"Are macaques a possible cryptid from Northeastern China, Inner Manchuria and Korean peninsula ? About the supposedly extinct macaque species of northern East Asia",Mister_Ape_1,21,1739468140.0,"*Macaca anderssoni* Schlosser, 1924 is a fossil macaque found in East Asia (Schlosser, 1924, Delson, 1980, Pan and Yanzhang, 1995, Jablonski, 2002). In China, the large-sized *Macaca* specimens from the Early Pleistocene (ca. 2.6–0.8 Ma) have been identified as belonging to this species.

The holotype of *M. anderssoni* (PMU-M3651), a nearly complete face and palate from the Early Pleistocene of Mianchi, Henan Province, is remarkable in terms of its potential for interpreting phylogenetic relationships.

*M. anderssoni* is phylogenetically related to the *sinica* group (especially *M. assamensis*, *M. thibetana*, and *M. arctoides*). The populations of the *sinica* group were distributed in northern China during the Early Pleistocene. Currently, the populations of the *sinica* group are not distributed in northern East Asia, while those of the *fascicularis* group are.

Here the dispersal patterns of the *sinica* and *fascicularis* groups, and *M. leonina* are illustrated referring to the hypotheses by Delson ([1980](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajp.23142#ajp23142-bib-0010)), Fa ([1989](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajp.23142#ajp23142-bib-0014)), and Tosi et al. ([2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajp.23142#ajp23142-bib-0052)), except for entrances of the three major rivers.

[Excavations of Pleistocene fossil macaques have been reported from northern China and the Korean Peninsula](https://preview.redd.it/m8t1v7gntxie1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86ac8bfc688ae6160565beaf200b5b65ccf6355)

Rhesus macaques have the widest geographic ranges of any non-human primate, occupying a great diversity of altitudes. This species may be found in grasslands, woodlands, and in mountainous regions up to 2,500 m (8,200 ft) in elevation.

**A population of rhesus macaques in the Taihang mountains on the Henan-Shanxi border is probably the northernmost population of the species**. A more northerly population north of Beijing was locally extirpated in 1988.

Could the rhesus macaque still be a living species in modern day Northeast China, Inner Manchuria and the Korean peninsula ?

Can a local cryptid be identified with it ?

By the way, even though it is off topic to this post, I would like to point out it is not entirely true Mongolic people did not ever meet any non human primate before the expansion of the Mongol Empire.

Proto Mongolic steppe nomads, at the time their Proto Turkic close relatives lived in current Mongolia and did not already migrate westward toward West Eurasia, lived between current Inner Manchuria and Inner Mongolia.

[In 200 AD, the Xianbei and the Wuhuan, the descendants of the Donghu, were Proto Mongolic tribes living in Inner Mongolia and Northeast China](https://preview.redd.it/g9l9fxzpwxie1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc006ca39547b50d90f8179de962dc49d71b1e0)

Note, by comparing this picture to the first one, how the Proto Mongolic people are really close to the most northeastern Macaca fossils from Pleistocene and quite close to the most northeastern areas inhabited by Macaca mulatta until recent times.

Even then, macaques have basically NOTHING to do with the Almas legend, even if sometimes Mongolic people could have misidentified large macaques walking on 2 legs for the Almas itself since they would have rarely seen a macaque at all.

The actual reason I wanted to show this territorial overlap is the attitude of the Chinese people to compare non Han, barbarian populations to non human primates found in the same area. People from southern East Asia were compared to gibbons, Malaysians to orangutans, but the steppe people were compared to the macaque, which is not known to inhabit the Eurasian steppe. 

While it is said it was because the macaque has light colored fur and the steppe nomads had lighter pigmentation, compared to the Han, due to West Eurasian admixture, it is also true macaques did actually live in part of the grasslands territories of the nomads in the past. The comparison between steppe barbarians and macaques highlights the presence of Macaca mulatta in northern continental areas, way northward than any other already known, living non human primate."

CryptoTechnology,Biggest security issue with iOS hot wallets?,littelfish,15,1739243702.0,"Seems that no one really brings this one up, but isn't the biggest attack vector the fact that there is a person / team that is able to release updates for these hot wallets? Obviously, at the end of it, even though the source code is available on GitHub  and open source, that doesn't matter one bit, as someone is still taking this code and running the build scripts and then publishing the new version to the app store.

There is nothing stopping said individual from making some uncommitted changes locally before building and releasing a new version of the app (so not visible publicly on GitHub, etc.). These changes could purposefully introduce any number of malicious behaviours into the app, such as 1) deterministic private key generation for new wallets or 2) an inconspicuous private key logging mechanism or 3) have all transaction signing simply send to addresses that this individual owns. Effectively draining users' funds until people realize and the app gets rolled back or taken down. Even an hour of time with a malicious version out there is enough to cause significant financial loss.

This is my biggest fear with hot wallets. The more popular they get, and the more people are using them to store a large amount of bitcoin, cumulatively, the more tempting this becomes to the individual with the ability to roll out app updates. It just needs to get into the wrong hands.

Some ways in which this could be mitigated:

1. If Apple would allow users to disable automatic updates only for certain individual apps (such as hot wallets for example), and if they would allow checksum verifications with source code in some way, then the user could update to a new version on their own once they verify and audit the code themselves, or allow time to pass for others in the community to do so, etc.
2. If I somehow knew that Apple placed an extreme level of scrutiny for certain app updates, such as hot wallets, then this would at least be something.. But I truly have no idea if they apply any more rigor when reviewing actual code changes of hot wallets vs some random game.

Or perhaps I am missing something and this is well protected against? If someone can tell me why I should not be worried about this apparent flaw in the release cycle of hot wallet code, please enlighten me. As I do think absent of this particular problem, hot wallets can actually be very secure."

Now I am taking issue with the Merkle Tree explanation provided in this book. However to question material provided by Princeton would seem inconceivable. So I would like to ask this subreddit for clarification before I make a fool of myself in front of my professor. But I genuinely understand this book to be misrepresenting the merkle tree structure. I would APPRECIATE your feedback to my post and let me know what you think. Have I misunderstood something? Is the book making an error?

Ok, on to the material. Here is a direct quote from the book.

>Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. These blocks comprise the leaves of our tree. We group these data blocks into pairs of two, and then for each pair, we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks. These data structures make the next level up of the tree. We in turn group these into groups of two, and for each pair, create a new data structure that contains the hash of each. We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.

Here is a corresponding figure presenting a merkle tree structure from the book:

[https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png)

REBUTTAL:

The specific grievance is:

>we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks.

I claim this is not the case(with sources provided later). I claim the data structure(parent node) that is made for each pair contains the hash of the concatenation of the children. So if there is a pair of leaves A and B, the parent node does NOT contain two hash pointers for each leaf which is written as H(A) H(B) in the book's diagram. Instead, it contains a single hash of both A and B concatenated, that is  denoted as H(A||B).

Further, there are no pointers which let you instantly hop from the parent to its children. The only way to find the child given a parent in practice is by using index arithmetic because all of the nodes in a binary tree can be denoted using indexing. And indexing follows a structure that lets you navigate the tree.

I claim the above misunderstanding leads to a further misunderstanding regarding a proof of membership. As I understand, a proof of membership is the same as a proof of inclusion and a merkle proof.

Here is the text from the book:

>Proof of membership. Another nice feature of Merkle trees is that, unlike the block chain that we built before, it allows a concise proof of membership. Say that someone wants to prove that a certain data block is a member of the Merkle Tree. As usual, we remember just the root. Then they need to show us this data block, and the blocks on the path from the data block to the root. We can ignore the rest of the tree, as the blocks on this path are enough to allow us to verify the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. See Figure 1.8 for a graphical depiction of how this works.

Here is a diagram they provide:

[https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png)

REBUTTAL: Consider a trivial example of a merkle tree where it contains 3 nodes.  It has a root. The root has 2 children(leaf nodes in this case). Also assume a merkle tree is structured as I claim: The leaf nodes contain hashes of their corresponding datablocks. The parents of these leaf nodes contain the hash of the concatenated child hashes. And any further parents are recursively constructed in the same fashion.

Given this simple case, let the datablocks be denoted as A and B. Then one leaf node contains H(A) and the other contains H(B). The parent contains the hash H( H(A) || H(B) ).

I want to prove the membership of the datablock A. The book claims I need only provide the direct path from root to leaf node of A. And I claim this is NOT enough information. Suppose I do as the book states and provide the root and the leaf node containing H(A). First providing the leaf node H(A) is actually redundant. Anyone can fabricate the correct hash of a datablock on the fly. What we really want is a piece of information that confirms H(A) is indeed part of this tree where the hashes propagate upward to the root - and where the root is combined authenticator for all the elements in the tree. Ok so maybe adding the root will provide enough information? If I observe the hash stored in the root which is the output of H(H(A)||H(B)). Well this is NOT helpful! How can I confirm that H(A) was propagated upwards into the root and passed into a hash with H(B) concatenated. I have H(A), but I'm missing half of the input so how can I possibly reproduce the output of H(H(A)||H(B)) to verify? The only way to verify would be if I was provided H(B).

I claim the information that must be provided are the sibling nodes along the direct route from leaf to root which contradicts the claims in the book.

# What’s a prediction market?

It’s basically a way to bet on real-world events—elections, sports, stock prices, anything. If you think something will happen, you buy “Yes” shares. If you think it won’t, you buy “No” shares. The price moves based on what people believe the probability is. It’s like a stock market for real-world events.

# Why does this matter for crypto?

* They’re actually useful – Instead of just trading meme coins, prediction markets provide real-world value by showing what people *really* think will happen.
* Less censorship – A lot of places ban certain types of betting (especially political betting), but decentralized markets are harder to shut down.
* One of the best real uses for crypto – People always ask what crypto is actually *good for*. This is one of the best answers.
* Better than traditional betting – No middlemen, lower fees, and the odds are set by the market instead of bookies.

Platforms like Polymarket and Augur are already doing this, but it still feels early. If crypto is going to have real-world applications, **prediction markets could be one of the biggest.**

Curious to hear what others think—are prediction markets the next big thing, or is something holding them back?"

Sadly it all failed multiple times now am stuck. All I am trying to do is set up a local blockchain with at least 5 nodes that use Proof of Authority as the consensus algorithm. PLEASE HELP!"
CryptoTechnology,Bitcoin and XRP Discussions,Both-Mushroom8283,81,1737932530.0,"Hey everyone,

I'm planning to get in the market in a bit after researching quite a while about bitcoin and xrp. Both really fascinates me and believe both could co exist in the future to create the future of financial technology.

This is what I got and please correct me if I have mistakes and I'm open for discussion down in the comment sections so feel free! 

**Key Differences Between Bitcoin and XRP Algorithms**

**Consensus Mechanism**:

* **Bitcoin**: Uses **Proof of Work (PoW)**, where miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. This process is **energy-intensive** and relatively **slow**.
* **XRP (Ripple)**: Uses the **Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)**, which relies on a network of **trusted validators (Will talk about these later)** to reach consensus on transactions. It is **faster**, more **energy-efficient**, and does not require mining.

  
**Transaction Speed**:

* **Bitcoin**: **10 minutes** on average due to the time required to mine each block.
* **XRP**:  **3-5 seconds** due to its lightweight consensus algorithm. Very fast.

  
**Scalability (TPS-wise)**:

* **Bitcoin**: Processes about **7 transactions per second (TPS)**. Scaling has been a challenge due to its block size and consensus model (?)
* **XRP**: Can handle up to **1,500 TPS**, making it more suitable for large-scale, high-frequency use cases like global payments.

  
**Purpose**:

* **Bitcoin**: Designed as a **decentralized digital currency** and store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold.""
* **XRP**: Primarily developed as a **bridge currency** for cross-border payments and facilitating fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions.

# Combined Benefits for Financial Technology:

1. **Improved Efficiency**: Bitcoin’s decentralization and XRP’s speed/low cost can complement each other in creating hybrid systems that are both secure and scalable.
2. **Reduced Costs**: Both cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies in transaction and operational costs between countries.
3. **Innovation in Payment Systems**: By integrating blockchain technology, Bitcoin and XRP can inspire new solutions for digital payments, lending, and ""**ASSET""** tokenization.

  
Some questions that I have:

1. Can both co-exist with each other later?  
2. Is XRP decentralized or centralized?  

* Validators on the XRP Ledger include universities, financial institutions, and independent organizations, making the network less reliant on Ripple Labs.
* Since Ripple Labs created XRP and still holds a significant portion of its supply (over 40 billion XRP in escrow). This concentration of ownership can give Ripple Labs significant influence over the XRP market, defeat the purpose of decentralized currency like bitcoin.

  
Please correct me if I have any mistakes and I hope we could learn from each other :) Thank you!"

CryptoTechnology,Verifiable AI with TEEs and Blockchain,rayQuGR,82,1736769224.0,"AI systems are becoming increasingly powerful, but how can we trust their outputs and ensure they’re processed securely? Oasis Protocol is addressing this by combining Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with blockchain technology to deliver verifiable AI.

Here’s how it works:

* **What Are TEEs?** TEEs are secure hardware environments that isolate sensitive data and computations, protecting them from unauthorized access or tampering. Think of them as a vault for processing data while keeping it private.
* **Blockchain Integration**: By coupling TEEs with Oasis’s blockchain, computations performed inside these secure enclaves can be verified using cryptographic proofs. This guarantees that the AI models and their outputs haven’t been altered.
* **Why It Matters**: This combination enables decentralized applications to maintain both transparency and privacy, solving a key issue for industries that rely on sensitive data, such as:
   * **Healthcare**: Securely analyzing patient data without exposing it to breaches.
   * **Finance**: Ensuring fraud detection algorithms operate as intended without bias or interference.
   * **Government and Compliance**: Proving compliance with regulations while maintaining data confidentiality.

Oasis Protocol is paving the way for AI systems to gain trust in critical applications where verifiability is essential. By leveraging TEEs, they ensure computations are not only private but also provably correct—offering a balance of security and accountability. You can deep diver in their post [here](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/verifiable-ai-with-tees)."

CryptoTechnology,Blockchains algorithm full privacy ,EvilCorpRobot,367,1736085088.0,"Hello Reddit!

I'm excited to share with you all an innovative approach to blockchain security and privacy that I’ve been working on. The core idea of this algorithm is to enhance both transaction confidentiality and user anonymity without compromising the integrity of the blockchain itself. This is achieved primarily through the use of pseudonyms for each transaction, and I'd love to explain how it works!

Key Features:

1. Pseudonyms for Sender and Receiver:
Every transaction on the blockchain involves a pseudo-generated public address for both the sender and the receiver. These pseudonyms are essentially temporary identities tied to a private key that can only be used for that specific transaction. By doing so, the blockchain ensures that there is no direct link between the user’s real-world identity and their on-chain activities, enhancing privacy.

2. Transaction Fragmentation:
Transactions are fragmented into smaller parts that are independently validated, meaning that even if parts of the transaction are intercepted, it becomes nearly impossible to reconstruct the full transaction. This ensures extra layers of security and privacy.

3. Dual Validation by Two Groups of Miners:
To further enhance security, two separate groups of miners validate different aspects of each transaction. This reduces the risk of malicious actions and ensures that the integrity of the transaction is always maintained.

4. Cryptographic Protections:
I’ve incorporated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), ring signatures, and other advanced cryptographic techniques to guarantee that transaction details remain private while still allowing for secure verification on the blockchain.

Why Pseudonyms?

The use of pseudonyms in this system allows for complete privacy—even when transactions are verified, there is no way to trace back the transaction to any real-world identity unless the user explicitly reveals it. This is a key feature for anyone concerned with maintaining their privacy in a blockchain environment.

Additionally, it provides a layer of security against tracking and surveillance by making it incredibly difficult to correlate transactions between different pseudonyms, even if they are used by the same person.

What’s Next?

I’m hoping to take this concept further and eventually bring it to the real world. The system is designed to be scalable, meaning it can grow alongside the adoption of blockchain technology while maintaining privacy and security for all users.

If you’re into blockchain tech, privacy, or cryptography, I’d love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!


This blockchain algorithm uses pseudonyms for both sender and receiver, transaction fragmentation, and dual miner validation to ensure maximum privacy and security while maintaining a transparent and secure blockchain ledger."

CryptoTechnology,"[Thoughts on my idea]: Using blockchain to create ""proof of impact"" for charity donations
",mattsworrld,123,1735355270.0,"I'm aiming to solve a problem within philanthropy of mismanagement of resources/lack of transparency when using funds that are donated.

I'm brainstorming an idea which would be a platform where charities would have to issue some sort of NFT to each donor, which would allow donors to see direct proof of how their donations made an impact.

For example, if someone donated $10 for 10 trees to an organization that plants trees, the charity would issue 10 unique NFT's (via smart contract) to prove that these trees have actually been planted (via geotag for the exact coordinates, a photo or something else- not important in this example). This would serve as a ""proof of impact"" and would provide transparency in how funds are managed and donations used.

Users (donors) would have a platform to see their contributions, project updates, fund allocation, and milestones achieved in real time.

We would charge a % of each donation as a fee, but I'm still exploring if this idea is even viable and needed.

IMO people are much more willing to donate when they can see what they're getting for the money, and therefore getting donors to use our platform shouldn't be a problem; and the charities would be attracted to use our platforms with the access to additional donors.

This has use cases beyond large charities, it can be used to crowdfund projects (like Kickstarter), or individual donations (like gofundme).

Is this an idea worth pursuing?"

Take Bitcoin it gets so much heat for its energy consumption, but some argue it’s actually pushing renewable energy adoption forward. Then there’s Ethereum, which moved to PoS and cut its energy use massively. But does that centralize power among big stakers? Feels like it’s a tough trade-off either way.

I wrote about this recently in [Meta Wire](https://metawiredailywire.beehiiv.com/subscribe) (my newsletter) and didn’t expect such split opinions.

CryptoTechnology,Why I Don’t Think Crypto Can Replace Banks: The Trust Problem,LividElevator1134,5,1734785232.0,"Why I Don’t Think Crypto Can Replace **FIAT**

After extensive research and reflection on cryptocurrency, I believe that nearly all technologies in the cryptosphere won’t succeed. The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: **trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.**

Crypto overlooks the need for **oversight and intervention**. Without it, systems become dangerously exploitable. Crypto wallets often lack government IDs and use irreversible, sometimes untraceable transactions, making them prime targets for theft. As adoption grows, so might scams, threats, and violence. Without oversight, crypto can also be used to hide and launder money, promoting tax fraud and other criminal behavior.

Traditional bank accounts, in contrast, incorporate measures like withdrawal limits, fraud detection, transaction traceability and reversibility, and compliance checks (KYC and AML). These safeguards require centralized authorities with power and thus DeFi lacks foundational security.

Some argue that crime is minimal relative to total crypto transactions. Yet crypto grants users the freedom to commit these crimes if they choose, and the ease of doing so could incentivize tax fraud and other crimes. So while I admit privacy is important, your actions can’t be totally anonymous. Crypto is akin to having no police in a city.

Users are also fully responsible for their private keys, and that responsibility often leads to lost or accidentally destroyed wallets. Proper storage means creating multiple backups and maintaining a highly secure physical environment—no small task, especially when millions of dollars could be on the line. For most people, it simply isn’t practical or safe to manage that level of risk themselves. The sensible solution, in my view, is to rely on a centralized, trustworthy entity—i.e., a bank.

Hopefully, this illustrates the flaws in DeFi and why banks and governments remain necessary. For those who still believe a trustless blockchain is the solution where users bank themselves, remember that today’s “trustless” blockchains aren’t truly trustless. Oracles—offchain data sources that link onchain—cannot be verified cryptographically. While aggregation from multiple oracles can reduce risk, collusion remains possible.

The uncomfortable truth is that **trust is indispensable, despite its imperfections.** Instead of eliminating trust, we should focus on making our institutions more trustworthy—a far simpler approach. To replace TradFi, crypto would need to replicate thousands of centralized features in code—fraud resolution, asset recovery, tax compliance, oracle verification, criminal law, and more. This would require an enormous infrastructure of decentralized nodes running millions of lines bug-free code, making complex, nuanced decisions—well beyond current technology. And since “code is law,” human intervention would be nearly impossible when mistakes occur.

Maybe once we reach AGI, decentralized altruistic AI agents could run the financial system. Until then, I remain skeptical that most cryptocurrencies have any real, lasting value.

EDIT: I wrote this post right before learning that OpenAI announced o3, which some say is AGI 🙊 

There’s a lot I didn’t say because this is long enough but I think there is some good in blockchain via taking elements of it and applying them to centralized, permissioned systems.

For a blockchain to be successful on a global scale, it must have a good handle on:

* Decentralization
* Security
* Scalability

However, as things currently stand, one of these three factors are being sacrificed to some extent to achieve two of the others. This is what's called the blockchain trilemma.

I did a few internet searches and found the following names floating around when it comes to cryptos that are closer than others to solving the blockchain trilemma:

* Polkadot (DOT)
* Cosmos (ATOM)
* Nano (XNO)
* Algorand (ALGO)
* Hedera (HBAR)

What do you think? Now there could be criteria other than the ability to solve blockchain trilemma that can be used for determining technological superiority, if you think so I'd love to hear about that.

To be fair, I wasn't really thinking about this until very recently when I was reading about a few projects on CMC, but the way the ecosystem is setup, most users have no control over how their data is used or even monetized by tech companies.

We also cannot overlook the fact that personal data is usually vulnerable to breaches or misuse, and even if you decide to monetize your data, the average user lacks access to tools or platforms to participate in the data economy.

Although the project I was reading about, one that Bitget already listed VANA, mentioned enabling users to contribute their data to Data DAOs, which gives them ownership and control over their digital footprints.

CryptoTechnology,Trying to understand how it all works!,BareBonesTek,6,1733967343.0,"Hi,,

I'm doing some research at the moment for some work I need to complete and I have some quetions that I am struggling to find answers to. Can anyone here help? These mostly relate to scaling.

1. We all know that multiple copies of the complete chain are held on mutiple machines (some explanations say ""by every device participating in the chain"" although I suspect thst is not really the case!) So, my first area of interest is the size of the chain / data storage requirements. I have no idea how much disk space a single block takes up, but that is largely irellevant. If a particular chain is old and popular, surely it wil evenbtually grow to a size that makes it impractical? Can anyone comment?
2. The classic explanation of how a cryptocurrency works, is that the chain represents a ledger of all transactions. In order to figure out a particular address's balance (to see if they have enough to make a transaction) the explanation then basically states that the whole chain / ledger is scanned for transactions involving that address to calculate the balance. So, related to Q1, how is that done efficiently? I mean, if I have a chain that is (say) 10 years old, with several tens of billions of transactions in the ledger, wouldn't searching the chain for every transaction involving a particular address take an impractical amount of time? (Say, I have a waller running on my smartphone, how can it perform that search efficiently?) Or is there some clever algorithm in play here?
3. How is the ""winning"" miner decided upon? Regardless of ""proof"" somehow one entitly must ""win"", sign the block, add it to the chain and claim the reward? Again, say we have several thousand miners (and nodes) it's not unreasonable for more thsan one to get a solution before consensus can be reached. Given that the whole point is to have no central control, who gets to decide? Doesn't network latency get in the way?
4. I have a basic understanding of ""Proof of Work"" and how thi has led to a crazy amount of power being used on a glovbal scale for mining operations, but how do other systems work (""Proof of Stake"" / ""Proof of Storage"" etc.) and why are they more efficient? Do they also not have to ""solve"" the block in the same way that PoW systems do?
5. Who actaully executes smart contracts? By which I mean, where is the code actually run? Is it the miner? If so, how do we ensure that if the contract references external entites, it is only done once?

Thanks for reading this. Any insights you can offer would be greatly appreciatedf!"

While I am continuing to broaden my understanding about crypto and the blockchain, I'm really interested in recommendations for some more specific research. Right now I have a massive funnel of information and I'm basically choking on it all.

What really interests me is the potential for crypto and the underlying tech to make private equity and venture capital obsolete, as businesses, creators, and developers are able to use tokens to leverage their community as investors who want to directly support products/people/ideas they believe in and cut out the middle men of VC/PE and wall street (I currently hold stock in some VC/PE firms registered as BDCs because that's as close as I can get to those market opportunities, and also the whole ""accredited investor"" thing is BS, but I digress.) - something in between crowd funding and IPOs that are superior to both.

I had an ""aha"" moment when I was learning about how smart contracts have been used to code royalties into NFTs and stuff, and realized that this technology is vastly superior to the current way that basically the whole stock market operates. In my hopium-fueled future, shareholder agreements are coded on the blockchain and stock is replaced with tokens - and obviously not just stocks, but all sorts of asset classes, IP, etc, that most people don't currently have good access too.

I believe this is referred to as ""tokenization"" - but I'm still learning all the vocabulary - and also there seem to be a lot of different players out there talking about tokenization as part of their use case, but I'm not sure they all mean exactly the same thing or have the same vision for what that looks like.

If anyone could recommend specific cryptos that are working on this use, I will happily dive into them. I would prefer better known projects as opposed to deep-in-the-weeds altcoins, but if you think the technology is really compelling then I'm happy to look at it and learn even if only for my own edification and better understanding.

The four that I am currently studying are Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot - not specifically for what I mentioned above, but because they're the ones that are on my current reading list, although they all do seem to have some aspect of tokenization to them (opinions on these welcome).

Thanks in advance!

CryptoTechnology,A quantum computers effect on Bitcoin mining,Sargeinchage37,5,1733870669.0,"I did some digging but couldn’t find any answers related to this hypothetical question.

From my research, it clear quantum computers are a long way from cracking the encryption algorithms Bitcoin uses. However, technically if an algorithm existed today, a quantum computer could start mining Bitcoin. I’m guessing that a quantum computer could calculate the target hash much faster than all the traditional computer on the network so the difficulty of the target hash would need to increase to maintain the 10 minute block target.

If my assumptions about the process above are correct (feel free to correct if I am misunderstanding), I’m curious what would happen to Bitcoin if this quantum computer stopped mining. Would the block creation process come to a halt since the traditional computers remaining on the network would not be able to calculate a hash of such difficulty?"
CryptoTechnology,Working on a crypto system for privately buying digital goods. Need suggestions and feedback!,MAKEMONEYSMOKEASS,5,1733686408.0,"Hi everyone!

I’m working on a **privacy-focused project** and would love to get your feedback. The idea is an escrow platform where:

1. **Sellers submit a decryption key** to the escrow system.
2. Buyers negotiate a deal (likely on a third-party platform).
3. Once payment is confirmed, the decryption key is securely released to the buyer.
4. The platform includes a **rating system** for buyers and sellers to build trust.

Key Features:

* No files or documents are stored on the site. Only a decryption key for said item.
* Even if I wanted to investigate what’s being bought or sold, I wouldn’t be able to, since the files and transactions are separate. So 100% anon.
* The system relies entirely on the **validity of the key** and the buyer’s ability to decrypt their file.

# My Concerns:

I’m worried there might not be enough demand for a system like this. It seems like there are limited use cases where total anonymity is essential.

* Do you think this is a dumb idea?
* Are there specific use cases or scenarios where this would make sense?
* What would make you trust such a platform?

Say you want to buy a digital good (e.g., a license key, encrypted document, or script) in complete privacy. The seller won’t just send it to you because they can’t be sure you’ll pay. That’s where our site comes in:

The seller encrypts the digital good and submits the **decryption key** to our site. The actual encrypted file remains wherever they choose—Dropbox, a USB stick, email—completely outside our platform. Once you’ve sent payment and it’s confirmed, the system releases the decryption key to you. You can then use the decryption key, on the encrypted file inorder to recieve your product.

1. **Trust**: The seller is guaranteed payment, and you’re guaranteed the decryption key.
2. **Anonymity**: Since we never handle or store the file, even we couldn’t determine what’s being bought or sold.
3. **Security**: The process is entirely focused on the key, leaving the file’s storage up to the buyer and seller.

Only thing missing is the buyer needs to trust the seller, this I would use a rating/comment system for.

  
I’d really appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions. "

CryptoTechnology,Cere Network vs. Filecoin: Is Cere the Next Step in Decentralized Data and Storage for Web3?,SpacKingz,6,1732134252.0,"I’ve been diving deep into decentralized storage solutions, and I’ve been impressed with Cere Network’s approach to solving some of the key limitations of Filecoin. While Filecoin has made huge strides in the decentralized storage space, Cere Network’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) offers some unique advantages that I believe could make it a more scalable, private, and efficient alternative in the long term. Here’s why:

1. True Decentralization:

	•	Filecoin operates with a reliance on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which, while a powerful tool, still has issues around centralized bottlenecks—specifically, reliance on specific nodes for data retrieval. Cere Network is building its own decentralized storage layer, aiming for seamless on-chain data management, ensuring true decentralization without these limitations.

2. Optimized for Scalability & Speed:

	•	While Filecoin is good for long-term data storage, it struggles with real-time, high-speed data access, which is essential for Web3 applications and especially AI-driven projects. Cere’s DDC is engineered for high-throughput and low-latency access, enabling not just storage but real-time data sharing that’s critical for modern applications.

3. Privacy-Focused for Enterprises and AI:

	•	Cere offers a far more robust approach for enterprises looking to securely share and manage sensitive data, whereas Filecoin lacks the same level of privacy integration. With data privacy becoming an even bigger issue, especially in AI development, Cere’s architecture allows secure data sharing, which is vital for the next-generation Web3 applications and AI algorithms.

The AI Angle & Potential Data Marketplace:

One of the most exciting aspects of Cere Network’s infrastructure is its potential to create a decentralized data marketplace. This could be a game-changer, especially as machine learning and AI continue to grow exponentially. Here’s how:
	1.	Decentralized Data for AI Training:
Cere’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) could be the foundation for a marketplace where custom datasets are bought and sold. AI models need massive, high-quality datasets to train on, but often, acquiring these datasets in a decentralized manner is complex and expensive. Cere Network could allow individuals or companies to upload, sell, or share their data securely, creating a new market for customized datasets that can be directly accessed by AI developers and machine learning practitioners.
	2.	Access to High-Quality Data for Machine Learning:
Many organizations struggle to find curated datasets that are specific to their machine learning models, leading to delays and inefficiencies. With Cere, people could monetize their data in a way that is secure and transparent, providing AI developers with access to diverse, high-quality datasets that would previously have been difficult to acquire. This opens up new opportunities for cross-industry collaborations, allowing AI models to become more powerful and specialized.
	3.	Data Ownership and Control:
One of the major issues in the current landscape is data ownership. In many cases, the owners of valuable datasets (such as companies or individuals) don’t have control over how their data is shared or monetized. Cere’s infrastructure ensures that users can retain ownership of their data while still participating in a marketplace, where they can choose to license or sell access to it. This would ensure fair compensation for those providing data while fostering a new market for AI companies and machine learning developers.

Local Node Deployment and Custom Clusters:

Another groundbreaking feature that Cere Network offers is the ability to spin up local nodes and create custom clusters, giving users and developers the power to personalize their infrastructure in a way that is scalable and efficient. Here’s how this can revolutionize decentralized storage and data usage:
	1.	Spin Up Local Nodes:
	•	Cere’s flexibility allows anyone to set up local nodes on their own hardware. This is a huge benefit because it reduces dependency on centralized providers and creates a truly decentralized ecosystem where users can participate from their own servers. Whether you’re an enterprise or an individual, the ability to host nodes locally means that Cere’s network can grow organically across different regions without relying on centralized cloud services.
	2.	Customizable Data Clusters:
	•	Cere goes beyond just providing data storage. It allows users to build and configure custom clusters that meet their specific needs—whether that’s handling particular types of datasets, optimizing for machine learning workloads, or even tailoring the storage configuration for specific AI applications. This is a huge advantage for developers looking for more control over their infrastructure and those who require high-performance data access for complex tasks.
	3.	Seamless Scalability for Enterprises and AI:
	•	As demand for data increases, being able to scale your local node infrastructure is key. Cere Network provides an easy way to expand clusters dynamically, ensuring that enterprise-level applications, especially those leveraging AI and machine learning, have access to unlimited scalability without being constrained by traditional centralized models.

Why This Could Be a Game-Changer:

With the rise of AI, the demand for large-scale, diverse, and privacy-compliant datasets is skyrocketing. Cere Network isn’t just building a decentralized storage layer; it’s positioning itself as a deep layer infrastructure project that could lay the foundation for a global decentralized data marketplace. By creating an ecosystem where data providers and AI developers can securely exchange data, Cere can unlock a massive revenue stream while also driving forward the development of AI.

By allowing custom node setups and the ability to deploy clusters locally, Cere can offer unmatched scalability and flexibility for decentralized data storage. This could lead to the creation of a decentralized infrastructure capable of handling the most demanding AI applications, enabling developers and businesses to access data on their own terms.

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

crypto,Why Do Some SSL/TLS Libraries Lack Support for Crypto Modules/Tokens?,fosres,11,1738479856.0,"I was reviewing cURL's sheet comparing TLS libraries (https://curl.se/docs/ssl-compared.html).

I was surprised when I found only two supporting crypto modules/tokens following the PKCS #11 standard.

Why are there so few TLS libraries supporting crypto modules/tokens operating under the PKCS #11 standard?"
crypto,Optimal Secure Curves For ECC as of 2025?,silene0259,8,1738328321.0,"What are the optimal secure curves for ECC? I have been using Curve25519 because of https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ and also want to implement Curve448.

BLS12_381 is another interesting one, especially for zkps."
crypto,Probability of randomly generating an EC public key,LikelyToThrow,4,1738163182.0,"From what I understand the size of a secp256k1 EC public key is 65 bytes (out of which one is a prefix byte so lets ignore that). The private key is any 256-bit number in [0, N] where N is the order of the curve. So if I have a random 64-byte stream, the probability of it being a valid EC public key on the curve is `N / 2^512 = 2^256 / 2^512 = 2^{-256}`. Does this sound right?

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"". So then how would I find the probabilty of a random 32-byte stream being a valid EC public key on the (secp256k1) curve? Does the probability remain the same?"
crypto,Best beginner cipher to try to solve?,Inner-Car-5589,12,1738022569.0,"Hi. As title goes, I’m getting into cryptography I’d like to know if there’s any online puzzles or beginner ciphers I can try to solve to start getting into this. Thanks"
crypto,Use of cryptographic primitives,saccharineboi,9,1737975813.0,"I was reading this [paper](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/4060550) that claims to ""combine metaverse with blockchain"", but I have a hard time understanding their use of primitives. On page 4 they first generate the key-pairs (not sure which scheme?):

https://preview.redd.it/zpkop4rklife1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cef80acf6bafc73585f06bb71a8a565fea02afb

Then the patient uses his/her private key to sign the data, and then the hospital encrypts it (page 5):

https://preview.redd.it/cbur2iezlife1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac36069b1d42256c93ab9d1d7aaa3e18fc195691

So I'm guessing (pk0, pk1) is probably from Ed25519 but (ak0, ak1) may be from X25519. The patient data is then encrypted using ak0, but isn't that something you aren't supposed to do? The paper doesn't mention the size constraints on patient data either.

It then says that:

>The newly generated data has to be validated before they can be added to the blockchain. These data are validated by the admin (doctor, pathologists, radiologists) following the process depicted in figure 5 using the admin private key ak1.

  
But figure 5 doesn't mention ak1:

https://preview.redd.it/bn0ei7e8oife1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfec3ff0b2a196be1bc860067ca2b41072b4e014

What was the point of ak\* anyway given that the hospital is the one encrypting the data in the first place? Am I missing something?"

Wrote a manifesto in 2001 about making a mark without leaving a trace

Subscriber to cryptome.org in 2001


Early Signs of a Bitcoin-like Mindset

In 2003, Dorsey posted a bio mentioning his interest in crypto, pseudonyms, and 4 AM hacks

That same year, he declared he was ending his dependence on the U.S. dollar and was creating a barter network

Used the pseudonym ""Jak"" instead of Jack


Suspiciously Timed Events Around Bitcoin’s Birth

August 17, 2008: Jack, an avid sailor, tweets: ""Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way."" Bitcoin.org is registered the next day.

His Twitter bio from Sept '07 - Jan '09 mentioned that he was a sailor.

The original Bitcoin source code contains an old sailor’s adage: ""Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.""

Bitcoin’s source code documents were timestamped at exactly 4 AM, aligning with Jack’s known hacking hours.

Bitcoin’s source code includes a brute-forced vanity address starting with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7), timestamped 1/7/09.

January 10, 2009: Satoshi accidentally logs into IRC revealing a California IP address—Jack was in California.

January 11, 2009: First Bitcoin transaction occurs—this is Jack’s mother’s birthday.

November 19, 2009: Satoshi joins the Bitcoin forum—this is Jack’s birthday.

May 3, 2010: Satoshi’s last mined block—this is Jack’s father’s birthday.


Dorsey's Bitcoin Connections Post-Satoshi Disappearance

Jack’s San Francisco address was 2 Mint Plaza (jD2m)—he later sent Bitcoin to addresses containing ""jD2m.""

Satoshi tells Martti Malmi he is ""busy with work""—Jack was busy launching Square (now Block).

December 5, 2010: Satoshi advises against donating Bitcoin to Wikileaks.

May 23, 2011: Twitter’s tech lead suggests Bitcoin integration.


Jack's Public Relationship with Bitcoin

September 2012: Jack calls Bitcoin an ""amazing movement"" and suggests Square will adopt it if widely accepted.

2013: Alyssa Milano, Jack's best friend, releases Hacktivist, a novel featuring a protagonist living a double life behind a pseudonym.

March 31, 2014: Square announces Bitcoin acceptance.

September 8, 2014: Satoshi’s email is hacked, and the hacker claims knowledge of Satoshi’s connection to St. Louis (Jack's hometown).

2015: Milano releases Hacktivist 2, where the protagonist’s famous pseudonym is hijacked, featuring a logo similar to Gavin Andresen’s Bitcoin Faucet logo.

August 15, 2015: Satoshi reappears on the Bitcoin mailing list amid the block size debates, sparking doubts about the authenticity of the return.

October 15, 2015: Jack becomes permanent CEO of Twitter.

2018: Square releases a children's book about the ""Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto,"" where Satoshi resembles Jack.


Recent Jack Dorsey & Bitcoin Connections

April 20, 2020: Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi—Jack coyly replies he wouldn’t admit it if he were. Unlike Szabo, Back, and Finney, Jack never outright denies it.

May 25, 2020: 145 old Bitcoin addresses sign a message calling Craig Wright a fraud. One of these addresses starts with ""1jak"" (Jack’s pseudonym). Another includes ""HiSQ"" (SQ = Square, Jack’s company).

February 2022: Jack starts wearing a Satoshi t-shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast, then at the Super Bowl.

October 27, 2023: At a conference, Jack states, ""Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved.""

Early 2024: Craig Wright’s attorneys argue that if he is not Satoshi, the real Satoshi should come forward to refute the claim. Jack, through his involvement in the COPA v. Wright lawsuit, does exactly that.

July 21, 2024: Jack posts on Nostr: ""I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all.""

August 28, 2024: Jack thanks Hal Finney (now deceased) on Nostr.

A Work of Art or a Hidden Truth?

The prevailing belief that Satoshi never wanted to be found is an assumption created by others. Jack himself has clarified that Satoshi chose pseudonymity, not anonymity. Given his deep involvement in cryptography, early Bitcoin-era events aligning with personal milestones, and his long-time cryptic nods to Satoshi, is it possible that Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin as a form of digital art? A masterpiece of financial revolution?

Or is he simply the ultimate Bitcoin enthusiast, subtly playing into the mystery?

What do you think? Could Jack Dorsey really be Satoshi Nakamoto?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the FIRST month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 FEB Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **JAN Highlights:** Mixed month, but overall up.  **XRP** nabs the monthly lead followed by **SOL**.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+323% vs S&P500's +766% - see below for details).

# Month One – Up +7%

https://preview.redd.it/trx8sjru1bje1.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcfb2b9a3a84d8b1c7bb96218ff95a1873cf86e5

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

January highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **XRP** and **SOL** lead the way
* Mixed month, but gains outpace losses 

# January Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/bzr1catv1bje1.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=3634081a2542903b9d2017dd280b0afdae59a6e9

# January Winners and Losers

***January Winners*** – **XRP** (+38%) easily took the monthly victory followed by **SOL** (+20%)

***January Losers*** – **AVAX** (-5%) and **BNB** (-4%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: A mixed but mostly green start to the year

In contrast to [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1), this year is off to a fairly good start (the 2024 Top Ten portfolio was down -14% after one month).

**XRP** is out to an early lead (up +38% in January) followed by **SOL**, +20% so far in 2025.  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** thirty days ago is worth $138 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/j7r49y1x1bje1.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e235240c03d3433c599294395b266c37ff73941

The portfolio gained $66 (+7%) in January so the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$1,066.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, one month later: 

https://preview.redd.it/cai0brxy1bje1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=527600a5a248fa851922b1157ea4c25fce7e9d3a

**January Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +7% 
* **COIN50**: +3%

The January monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +73% (total value $1,725)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +761% (total value $8,612)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +1010% (total value $11,098) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +391% (total value $4,911)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up +5% (total value $1046) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +240% (total value $3,399)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +100% (total value $1,998)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +7% (total value $1,066)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$33,855**

https://preview.redd.it/s8v0vci12bje1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf7abe1e229b0ac861308ffbb4d021049b16acc

**That’s up +323%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hbnt3pe22bje1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ca9d18c0995634af7a64b2d7b23b71313f9a5

In summary: ***That’s a +323% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,027 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,260 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,411 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,870 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,608 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,268 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,574 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,266 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,027 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,284.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+323%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

Not a bad start to the year for crypto, we’ll see what 2025 holds for the Top Ten Portfolio.   

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  January’s extended report is on the [OG 2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85).

CryptoCurrency,The fact we have continual focus on price and such shows 99% only care about a profit. Is that true for everyone?,setokaiba22,37,1739657923.0,"I feel nearly every single article or post here and on ‘news’ sites just has a focus on breakouts, price charts and such. There’s very ever little focus on the technology (perhaps with Musk’s actions lately that’s swayed a little), but arguably 99% of the interest in Cryptocurrency is purely about making money.

It’s become the same as a stock or share in its focus and reporting. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing really - it’s why many coins have the value they have today. And why we see big companies pump and dump.

Is actually holding or buying because they think the technology is great or say Bitcoin will become a major currency or is it everybody is just here to make money and hope it takes off more?"

CryptoCurrency,Is Crypto Nullifying Safe Gambling?,Howdoibuycrypto,2,1739676831.0,"Every day, as part of my career in the crypto casino space, I see more and more no-KYC casinos popping up. At first, it’s easy to see the appeal obviously, instant sign ups, total anonymity, no verification waiting times. Just deposit your crypto and start playing. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder: is this actually a good thing?

These casinos, despite being licensed in various jurisdictions, don’t ask for ID, proof of age, or any personal details. That means literally anyone with crypto can deposit, gamble, and withdraw their winnings with zero true oversight. That includes minors, problem gamblers, and even people looking to use these platforms for malicious reasons. And yet, people celebrate this as a feature, not a flaw or at least something we should keep an eye on, if not even intervene somehow. 

I get the privacy argument. Nobody wants to hand over sensitive personal data to a company they barely trust. We’ve all heard horror stories of leaked databases, identity theft, and government overreach. And let’s be real, traditional online casinos are a bureaucratic nightmare when it comes to withdrawals. Not just from a KYC POV but also from a payout time POV. KYC delays, frozen accounts, endless document requests—it’s frustrating. So, I completely understand why people want no-KYC casinos and it’s only crypto that seems to be able to offer that right now. 

But here’s where it gets dark for me at least:

Underage gambling – A 15-year-old with access to Bitcoin or USDT can gamble with ease. No ID, no questions asked.

Problem gambling – Without KYC, there are no self-exclusion programs, no deposit limits, no real way to intervene if someone is spiraling into addiction.

Financial crime risks – Crypto already has a reputation for being used in money laundering. No-KYC casinos make it even easier to move funds under the radar.

So, where do we draw the line? Should privacy take full priority, even if it means opening the doors to these risks? Or should the industry find a middle ground such as maybe allowing small transactions without KYC but requiring verification for larger amounts? Some casinos are already exploring this hybrid approach. Is that the best way forward for the industry? Keep both parties equally only half-happy?

I’m really curious about what others think. Are no-KYC casinos a step toward financial freedom, in the sense of giving you control of your identity— even when  it comes to A CASINO, or are they a ticking time bomb for responsible gambling?"
CryptoCurrency,Tipping system like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee but with crypto ?,Nayko93,12,1739638493.0,"Hi

I'm looking for a way to accept small tips and donations from users in my community  
I will probably make a Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee account, but those services only accept fiat money via stripe, cashapp, paypal... and I know some people don't like to use those and would prefer sending a tip in crypto (well known crypto that are easy to deal with and widely accepted, so bitcoin ethereum and monero)

So I've looked online for a tipping platform like those 2 but with crypto, but I can't find anything useful, not even a reddit post talking about the idea, which I find really weird

The ONLY thing I've found is this website called ""cwallet"", but it seem fishy as hell, the website itself look like something big and professional, but except the website itself, there is absolutely no info about it online, no one talking about it on reddit or any other forums

So I'm asking all of you here, is there such a thing as a platform where you can receive tips in crypto that redirect them to your wallet ?

Please it have to be something SIMPLE like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee

I know I could simply give my wallet address directly or a QR code and tell people to donate there, BUT I want to offer small compensation for the tips like special roles and customisation on discord, so I need the person tipping to be able to send a small message with their username with the tip

I also know that ultimately I could make a webage with a crypto paiement tool, something where you select the amount you want to give, it generate a QR code for the right amount to my wallet, it allow people to enter a small message that I would receive by mail or something, and the system check the blockchain to see if the paiement is real and once it's confirmed it send the mail with the confirmation + the user's message...  
But this is faaaar beyond what I can do...

Thanks for your help :)"

I am from the US, and I used to use Coinbase's paycheck feature where a part of my paycheck that gets deposited into coinbase was used to automatically but set crypto at no additional fees.

""This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,"" he said, adding he would ""absolutely not"" give up.

The value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about £620m, Mr Howells said ""it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this"" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies.

My theory is there might not even be a hard drive he's doing this for the publicity and in the UK you get paid for certain articles written about you.

CryptoCurrency,question regarding on how to determine position size,BadBLUNT,0,1739674128.0,"i created this example to help me with this formula i found in the book called ""The crypto trader"" by **Glen Goodman** and idk if i got it right i spent like an hour or so trying to figure it out sicne it was so confusing so if u guys can tell me if i understood the formula right that would be really nice heres the formula :

  
total budget : $100 000



price of the crypto ATM : $0.91



ATR on 30 days : $0.129



price i bought at : $0.91



price of my stop loss : 0.714





so to my determine position size i should determine the difference between the price i bought at versus the stop loss (support line)



0.91 - 0.714 = 0.196

price bought at - stop loss = the money risked per coin 



since i only want to risk 1% or less of my total capital i multiply by 5000 the money risked per coin to make it to $980 (wich is 0.98% of 100 000)

0.196 x 5000 = 980



now that i know that i want 5000 coin lets multiply the ATR by 5000 so it matches the the equation we did before 

0.129 x 5000 = 645





now with those position i can say that i have 1.51 ATR (wich means if the crypto goes 1 and a half days downward at a rate of 0.129 per coin (or by $645 since i bought 5000 coin) the stop order will be trigered

I mean Russia could be pumping millions into the coin with no intention of selling back because Trump is going to force Ukraine to succeed territory therefore helping Russia with war .

You don’t really even have to go down any rabbit holes to think of other type deals. 

Trump has already made 100 million just on fees. So the long game does not have to end with $trump being worth anything when he could sell in a year with the 80% unlock scheme.

CryptoMarkets,A Short Reminder,MVazovski,3,1739651998.0,"Hello all,

I am posting this as a mere reminder of who you shouldn't trust. You shouldn't trust rich people, celebrities, influencers, people you watch videos of every day, people who follow something blindly and can't explain in short, simple terms as to why you should invest in something. Now, the presidents are also added to the list. Until today, it was limited to US, now Argentina. Soon, the other countries and their presidents will follow suit. Remember how a lot of people got dumped NFTs on them and are still holding the bags today. Remember how there were so many scammers in 2021 and 2022. The numbers will definitely go up.

For degens, it spells opportunity, more people will fall for scams and more people will lose money, some degens will try hopping on the hypetrain early so they can 10x or 20x their money and dump on unsuspecting people. 

Please do not trust anyone. If you care about your loved ones, friends, family and you have been talking to them about crypto currencies, please inform them about the risks of so called ""meme""coins or ""utility"" coins which ""promise"" to ""change the game"" or some other bs.

Remember: Diamond hands, paper hands, FUD... these are just buzzwords to keep you in whatever scam someone is pulling (even though FUD is a real term used in a different context, not scams). Nobody wants to lose anyone that is buying into their scam because that means more money for them. 

Stay safe out there, people. God bless."
CryptoMarkets,BTC - the jig is up,StrategyComplete9982,1,1739669482.0,"Plan B, a person that some of you may follow. i personally think he is nothing more than a common average intelligence used bitcoin salesmen (thats what i call the btc influencers who make stupid predictions that never come true). His stock to flow chart (the only thing he did), is not holding up this cycle. Last week he was calling for 500k, now he moved all his btc to ETFS. His entire holding into ETFs. What does that mean?  It likely means he believes the years of crazy volatility (where you make money) are over. No longer will BTC drop 5x -25x from top to bottom allowing you to 5x -25x your money if you play the cycles. The jig is up, there are no new retailers bc everyone is onto the cycle theory, everyone knows this. The ETFs will provide a price floor. So by moving to ETFs, he is saying, without saying that there is may not be anymore cycles to play.  Is this good or bad, I am not smart enough to figure that out. If it is TRUE and the cycles are very reduced (say we only drop to 70k from here for the bear), the ONLY way BTC goes up is new money. No more of the same people buying and selling to each other as has happened in BTCs history. Need massive new adoption asap. Thoughts?"

I would still file my taxes in fiat as usual, so compliance isn’t an issue—I just want to keep my money outside of a bank. (i had very bad experience in the past, me obeying the law, but they obviously not and abusing their powers, so i am not trusting them anymore)

* Accepts standard payment methods (Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
* Automatically converts the received fiat to stablecoins
* Deposits the stablecoins directly into my wallet
* Operates in a tax-compliant and legal manner

CryptoMarkets,Why Are Some of the Best Crypto Projects Still Overlooked?,Ok-Western-5799,35,1739524967.0,"It’s interesting how some projects seem to be making real progress under the radar while others dominate headlines just off hype. I’ve been looking at different metrics, TVL growth, real adoption, network upgrades, and it’s clear that some ecosystems are quietly getting stronger without making much noise.



Take EOS, for example. It had a reputation for years as an ""old"" project, but if you actually check the numbers, it’s been making serious moves. TVL is near an all-time high, adoption is increasing, and the latest upgrades (like the Antelope Spring update) have improved efficiency and tokenomics. It’s even part of the Coin50 Index, which tracks the strongest smart contract platforms in the market, and it’s currently the second-best performer in that category.



But despite all that, it’s not a name you see constantly hyped on CT or Reddit. Maybe it’s just because newer projects steal the spotlight, or people still associate it with the past, but I feel like narratives shift fast in crypto. We’ve seen it before—Solana was “dead” in 2022, and now it’s everywhere again.



Another one I’ve been keeping an eye on is Kaspa (KAS). It’s been flying under the radar but has a unique approach with its blockDAG structure, allowing high-speed transactions while maintaining decentralization. Unlike a lot of L1s, it doesn’t rely on gimmicks—it’s pure proof-of-work but with a design that solves a lot of Bitcoin’s scaling issues. The adoption is slow but steady, and if you look at its trajectory, it feels like one of those projects that could explode when the market catches on.



What other projects do you guys think are building quietly while the market focuses on the same handful of names? Are there any ecosystems you’re watching that you think will get more attention once the market picks up?"

CryptoMarkets,XRP ETF Looks Like A Reality,ExtremeWhitewaterGuy,39,1739496548.0,"
The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale and NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF. The countdown to the approval of several spot XRP ETFs has begun.
The SEC has just given a green light to Grayscale’s proposal for a Spot XRP ETF by officially acknowledging the 19b-4 filing submitted via NYSE Arca—and now they’re calling on the public for feedback. In the filing posted last Thursday, the commission set a 21-day deadline for comments after the notice hits the Federal Register. Once that window closes, the SEC will decide whether to give this ETF the thumbs-up, knock it back, or even open up formal proceedings.

This 19b-4 filing is a crucial second step in launching a spot XRP ETF. Once it’s published in the Federal Register, the regulatory process really kicks into gear.

Recently, a slew of crypto ETFs—from Solana to Dogecoin—have been on the SEC’s radar as firms test the waters for regulatory approval.

The Crypto Thaw
This shift comes as the SEC appears to be easing up on its crypto stance following former Chair Gary Gensler’s departure last month. Gensler was famously skeptical, often labeling most cryptocurrencies as securities. In contrast, the agency has already approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and later, spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a more welcoming environment for digital assets.

Asset managers including WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have each submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF would allow investors to gain direct exposure to XRP without the hassle of holding the coin. This isn’t just a clever piece of financial engineering—it’s a potential game-changer that bridges the gap between traditional Wall Street and the fast-moving crypto frontier.

These filings are more than just regulatory checkboxes; they’re statements of intent. The idea is to democratize access to XRP, inviting both retail investors and institutional titans to partake in what many see as the next big chapter in crypto history.

Today the SEC acknowledged Grayscale and the NYSE’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF.  It’s the bullish XRP news that Ripple watchers have been waiting for. 

xrp price prediction

XRP ETFs are close to approval wrote Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X

Green Light Soon?
The SEC’s nod to the XRP 19b-4 filings isn’t just a bureaucratic checkbox—it’s a pivotal move in the ETF approval saga. While it doesn’t guarantee approval, it clearly shows that the wheels are turning. If, and when an XRP ETF does eventually get the green light, we could be staring down the barrel of a major institutional investment wave, one that’s likely to boost liquidity and demand significantly.

With regulatory clarity inching closer and Ripple making bold strides on the global stage, we have to ask: Are we on the verge of witnessing XRP’s metamorphosis from a mere utility asset into a bona fide mainstream financial instrument? If so, this isn’t just evolution—it’s a revolution that could upend traditional investment paradigms. XRP to the moon.

A Shifting Regulatory Landscape
With pro-crypto President Trump in charge, and new SEC chair Paul Atkins at the helm—whose track record hints at a more open-minded approach to digital assets—the stage is set for XRP ETF applications to clear the regulatory hurdle.

This potential pivot isn’t just about XRP—it’s emblematic of a broader transformation in how regulators might handle digital assets. For contrarians like us, it’s a fascinating development. While some fear that regulatory embrace could water down the decentralized ethos of crypto, others see it as the inevitable maturation of a market that’s been too raw for too long.

Market Impact: Bulls Charging, Bears on Alert
The ripple effects of these ETF applications could be huge. Analysts are already speculating that if approved, these ETFs could inject between $4 billion and $8 billion in net new assets into the XRP ecosystem within the first year. That’s not chump change—it’s a tidal wave of capital that could drive XRP’s price and liquidity to new heights. That means XRP price predictions for 2025 will have to be adjusted higher. As you can see on the XRP price chart below, the XRP price moved 4% higher on today’s news.

CryptoMarkets,SOLANA vs BNB (Binance),Current_You_,0,1739529343.0,"**Binance** and **Solana** are fundamentally different in their scope, centralization, and market influence. Here’s a breakdown:

# 1. Centralization & Business Model

* **Binance (BNB Chain & Binance Exchange)**:
   * Binance is a **fully centralized** company with a regulatory presence (despite facing scrutiny in some countries).
   * It operates a **crypto exchange**, which is one of the largest globally, alongside **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**.
   * Binance has multiple business arms, including Binance Pay, Binance NFT, Binance Academy, and more.
   * **BNB Coin** is used for trading fee discounts, DeFi, staking, and various exchange-related utilities.
* **Solana (SOL)**:
   * Solana is a **decentralized blockchain** focused purely on **speed and scalability** with a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus model.
   * It doesn’t have a centralized company backing it the way Binance does.
   * While Solana has strong DeFi and NFT adoption, it has suffered from **network outages** multiple times.
   * SOL is mainly used for **network fees, staking, and DeFi applications**.

# 2. Market Influence & Use Cases

* **Binance (BNB)**
   * Operates a **trading empire** handling billions of dollars daily.
   * Has a **real-world company structure**, giving it more legitimacy and operational security.
   * BNB has multiple utilities **inside and outside** of Binance, making it more integrated into the crypto world.
* **Solana (SOL)**
   * Purely a **blockchain network** competing with Ethereum.
   * Its growth is fueled by **NFTs, DeFi, and smart contract applications**.
   * Unlike Binance, Solana does not have a centralized exchange or company to support its stability.

# 3. Market Capitalization & Longevity

* Historically, **BNB has been more resilient** than SOL due to its **centralized backing and multiple revenue streams**.
* Solana, on the other hand, has seen **more volatility** and suffered major crashes in the past.
* **BNB is usually more stable than SOL** because of Binance’s **business model and exchange dominance**.

# Which is “Bigger”?

* **In terms of market cap**, they are **very close** (BNB recently surpassed SOL again).
* **In terms of real-world influence, Binance (BNB) is bigger** because it’s an entire **ecosystem + exchange**, while **Solana is just a blockchain**.

**Final Take: Binance (BNB) is more stable and influential in the crypto space than Solana (SOL)** because it is backed by an entire **business ecosystem**, whereas **Solana relies only on its blockchain adoption**."
CryptoMarkets,"Why do so few traders keep a journal, even though it’s one of the best ways to improve?",AdCultural4935,3,1739501316.0,"Hi, just wanted to rant a little bit.

Everyone says keeping a trading journal is crucial for improvement, but from what Ive seen, most traders dont do it at all.

I know its tedious to manually write down every trade, especially when you’re trading multiple pairs or scalping. But after forcing myself to review my trades regularly (i automated it cause manual is a pain in the ass), I realized it helped way more than I expected.

Seeing recurring mistakes helped me cut them out.

\- Tracking setups showed me which ones actually worked vs. just “felt good.”

\- Decomposing of returns (Do i have an edge irrelevant of conditions or is just market drift moving my positions?

\- A big part of the ""confidence"" component comes from systematizing your trading and recording the results. Data exhaust from your own trading is more valuable than any information the market can give you, and its impossible to know how things are going if you dont follow your own rules. Let data be your confidence.

\- Reducing costs is free alpha with zero volatility. People genuinely understimate how much not executing properly tanks your profits.

That said, I still feel like most traders dont journal. Is it just because its too much work, or do people not realize the huge benefits it provides? Do you guys track your trades in any way?

EDIT: so theres interest/people asking about the automated tool ive built. i'll leave here the link [https://tradestream.xyz/](https://tradestream.xyz/) (its completely free) I dont want to break any rules about promoting something so please let me know if this cant be done, thank you.

CryptoMoonShots,"UAE, DAMAC, Sovereign Funds... Why is $OM MANTRA pumping, and is it just getting started?",MrPenghu,881,1739645043.0,"Been watching something interesting in crypto space and wanted to share my thoughts.

$OM hit $8 today with a +40% jump. What's crazy is this happened without even being listed on any major US or Korean exchanges yet, means that market is basically untouched.

Some stuff I noticed:

* Started around $0.20 just 12 months ago—now up **3,900%** to hit $8.
* Best performer during the bear market and team is expanding 
* Building for real estate tokenization
* Getting serious backing

Here's what caught my eye recently: Abu Dhabi's Mubadala (their huge wealth fund) just bought $436M in Bitcoin ETFs in Q4. Interesting timing because MANTRA got $11M funding led by Shorooq Partners, and they're backed by these same big funds - Mubadala, JADA, Saudi Venture Capital, and ADQ.

What's interesting is seeing big real estate players like DAMAC actually getting involved. Not just announcements - they're actually planning to put properties on the blockchain and they have picked MANTRA Chain after exploring all other options.

The market moves are pretty interesting right now. SUI and SOL performed well, and now institutional money seems to be quietly moving into RWA stuff. And UAE isn't slowing down their crypto push at all - they're going all in.

Looking at all this - the institutional backing, real estate connections, and major exchange listings in Korea, US - makes me wonder if we might see $OM in the top 10 this year? Doesn't seem crazy given they're one of the few projects with actual real big deals which includes MAG, Novus.

Real world assets are finally moving from all talk to actual use. Pretty interesting to watch, especially with big finance looking to get into crypto the proper way.

If I share in short, I see everything will be tokenized and MANTRA is going to capture a lot more of the market share.

What do you guys think?

🤖 Invade every social media platform
🤖 Generate infinite hype and engagement
🤖 Attract new recruits (aka “investors”)

PHASE 3: MEMECOIN DOMINANCE

Following the deployment of my robotic army, the final phase of my plan will begin: total market takeover.

Key events:
🔵 Staking & Yield Farming – So humans can earn while they sleep.
🔵 More CEX & DEX Listings – Expanding my influence.
🔵 Stake to Vote System – Giving humans the illusion of control.
🔵 HODL Booster – Rewarding those who pledge allegiance to the machine.

I CAN vouch for snake wif hat as I am in the chat frequently and this community is going to stick it out until the very end. There are times where it’s not perfect.

**How High Can GIGA BROCCOLI Go?**

They said meme coins couldn’t get bigger—$GIGABRO proved them wrong. They said crypto was done—$GIGABRO is bringing it back. This isn’t just a token, it’s a movement, a meme revolution, a giga-force of nature.

CryptoMoonShots,Let’s Collectively Stop Letting the Insiders Win,JOxen89,5,1739681962.0,"If you actually opened this post I’d like to think you’re just as fed up with what’s happening in this space as I am. Everyday, insiders and cabals are taking money from the Solana ecosystem and lining their bank accounts with it. Even all these supposed “Key Opinion Leaders” are now preaching a world of PvP or lose everything.

THIS IS NOT WHAT CRYPTO HAS BEEN ABOUT ALL THESE YEARS. All of this PvP is ripping away one of the most important, if not the MOST important thing…Community!

We can’t continue on in this space with this mentality. These insiders are the only ones set up to win within this type of system, using their power and influence to take your money. Meanwhile, the rest of us become more divided, jaded and frustrated. 

I’m here to put out a call to arms for all of crypto reddit. We used to come together and PvE a coin to insane heights. I know it’s still possible if we decided to work together, and take down the insiders and cabals.

Obviously, this is where I will insert my \**shill*\* and I’m sure the comments will be flooded with even more people saying why their coin is the best. But, let me explain why I think it should be this coin.

Step in $HEGE.

Hege is the underdog of this crazy crypto world. It’s literally about a Hedgehog that’s trying to win over the girl of his dreams, from some bro type a\*\*hole. We’re all in crypto trying to make something of ourselves, just like Hege, the main character of the story.

Let’s get into some details.

Hege is going on 10 months, and 10 days as of today. That alone is an insane feat in this space. The coin currently stands at a $10m MC and has had an ATH of $53m. It has survived multiple pullbacks and has always come back stronger.

It’s the first at something. It’s the first story based meme coin where chapters unlock at certain market caps. At $50m MC, we unlocked Chapter 5, and we have 5 more to go before we complete the first volume. This allows for some pretty unique content, since there are multiple character arcs, and always something new as chapters unlock. Imitated, but never duplicated, other coins have tried to copy $HEGE’s narrative, but all have failed and gone to 0.

The artwork that has been created over the last 10 months is PLENTIFUL. There’s so many little side stories made up of the other characters. Several chapters of the Hege story have been fully animated. There’s also been a constant surge of new artists coming in to put their own twist on $HEGE. And my favorite is the DRiP\_HAUS collabs, because they’ve opened the door for new, reimagined versions of Hege created by insanely talented artists! Just today they launched the Rogue Hege collection and it sold out within 2 mins at a 2 SOL mint price!

There’s even added utility to the Hegend NFT collection, which pays out a monthly reward to holders. As long as you hold an NFT, plus Hege, you get paid in Hege just for holding! This is all paid for by NFT royalties in the secondary market. Also, the Hegend artwork is just dope in general.

Lastly, and to bring it around full circle.. (but not last because there are so many other things I could talk about in the Hege universe..)

The COMMUNITY! The people in Hege are weirdly enough, just like Hege. They are kind. They are willing to lend a helping hand. They are the underdogs. They want to stick it to the insiders and cabals and prove that good people can make waves in this space. So many people comment on how the Hege community is special… and it is! You should come experience it for yourself and see if it’s something you want to align with.

Because I think $HEGE is the one we should all PvE on and send a big middle finger to the cabals and insiders, and maybe you’ll agree with me. Maybe not. Regardless, I hope we all make it in this crazy world, despite the daily barrage of assholes trying to scam us out of our hard earned money."
CryptoMoonShots,Snake Wif Hat (SSSSS),MaxCawke,176,1739614463.0,"Attention, crypto enthusiasts! The next big thing on Solana is here, and it's called Snake Wif Hat. This isn't just another memecoin; it's a cultural shift, a meme, and an opportunity you don't want to miss.

CryptoMoonShots,Swisstronik: A Promising Solution to Blockchain’s Scalability and Privacy Challenges,Rexythesol,4,1739681962.0,"Blockchain technology has revolutionized multiple industries, offering decentralized solutions for finance, supply chain management, and data security. However, despite its rapid growth, fundamental challenges such as scalability and privacy remain barriers to mainstream adoption. Swisstronik, an emerging blockchain project, aims to address these issues by leveraging zero knowledge proof (ZK proof) technology.

# The Role of Zero Knowledge Proofs in Blockchain

Zero knowledge proofs are cryptographic techniques that allow one party to prove the truth of a statement without revealing the underlying data. This is a game changer for blockchain privacy, as it enables transactions to be verified without exposing sensitive details. By incorporating ZK proof technology, Swisstronik ensures that user data remains private while still complying with verification requirements.

Beyond privacy, ZK proofs contribute to scalability by reducing the amount of data that nodes need to process. Traditional blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggle with transaction speed and high fees due to their reliance on full transaction verification. Swisstronik’s use of ZK proofs can optimize network efficiency, leading to faster and more cost effective transactions.

# Privacy and Compliance: A Crucial Balance

With increasing regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry, Swisstronik’s focus on privacy is particularly timely. Regulatory frameworks like the European Union’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) require blockchain projects to balance security and compliance. By implementing advanced privacy mechanisms, Swisstronik could offer a solution that satisfies both users’ need for confidentiality and regulators’ demands for transparency.

# Seamless Integration with Existing Ecosystems

Another advantage of Swisstronik is its compatibility with established blockchain networks. Instead of requiring developers to build entirely new infrastructure, Swisstronik can integrate with existing platforms, making adoption more feasible. This interoperability lowers entry barriers for businesses and developers, increasing its potential for widespread use.

# Conclusion

Swisstronik presents a compelling approach to solving blockchain’s privacy and scalability challenges. While its success remains to be proven, its innovative use of ZK proof technology positions it as a strong contender in the next evolution of blockchain. If Swisstronik delivers on its promises, it could play a crucial role in shaping the future of decentralized technology.

Smart Contract Integration: Utilize BSC's smart contract capabilities to create and manage BTC-based assets and applications.

Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Support: Access a wider range of trading pairs and liquidity pools by bridging assets from both chains.

Enhanced Security: Employs robust cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and security of cross-chain transactions.

Why BNBXBT Matters:

The cryptocurrency landscape is often fragmented, with users facing challenges when interacting across different blockchains. BNBXBT addresses this by providing a seamless bridge between BSC and BTC, fostering greater interoperability and opening new avenues for innovation and collaboration.

Use Cases:

DeFi Expansion: Integrate BTC liquidity into BSC-based DeFi platforms, enabling users to leverage Bitcoin assets in yield farming, lending, and borrowing protocols.

NFT Marketplace Access: Creators and collectors can transact with BTC on BSC-based NFT platforms, broadening the market and potential audience.

Cross-Chain dApp Development: Developers can build decentralized applications that operate seamlessly across both BSC and BTC networks, offering users a unified experience.

CryptoMoonShots,$OM - MANTRA - The Big Bull of Crypto Market. How high it can go from here ?,Rahul_2503,8,1739650557.0,"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he’s “a huge believer in crypto” and urged the SEC to “rapidly approve” asset tokenization. 

Crypto community needs to understand when Larry Fink is bullish on something, you need to pay attention to that.

Last year in March, BlackRock launched $BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), its first tokenized U.S. Treasury fun which aligned his vision is to tokenize all financial assets.


So how it is bullish for crypto and which projects are in pole position to get the max benefits.

For me I believe only MANTRA_Chain , a well established player in the RWA sector is poised for maximum growth.

I have my reasons and thesis for that…

Leading L1 for RWA

A Security first RWA Layer 1 Blockchain. ( 1st Project to have RWA Chain )

Built using Cosmos SDK, IBC compatible, with CosmWasm supported

Built-in Modules, SDKs and APIs to create, trade and manage regulatory compliant RWAs

Deal with UAE Giant MAG worth $500M 

Partnership with UAE’s regulated Bank - ZAND Bank 

Entry in aviation market with Novus Aviation Capital to Tokenize billions in aviation assets.

1B+ Deal with DAMAC

Institutional money flowing in $OM as a hedge to the markets and the charts are showing.

Recently MANTRA_Chain had secured $11M funding led by Shorooq Partners. 

Shorooq Partners are backed by heavyweight sovereign fund Mubadala, which recently discloses acquisition of $436 Million in Bitcoin ETFs in Q4. 


Tokenomics:
Ticker: $OM
Market cap: $7.3B
Staked supply: 35% 
FDV : $13B

Expected mcap of RWA - $16T

$ADA - Highest mcap $120B without any working dapp.

$OM with $100B+ TVL - The Vision of Co-founder JPM 

I genuinely it will trade above $50B FDV in 2025."

CryptoMoonShots,Enjoy the Ride – $POWSCHE Isn’t Just Another Pump & Dump,fegadi,1,1739660899.0,"
One of the biggest mistakes people make in crypto is rushing things. Always looking for the next 100x overnight, jumping from one project to another, chasing hype instead of substance. And sure, sometimes it works for a moment. But then? You’re left holding the bag, watching the next trend take off while you scramble to find another quick win.

$POWSCHE isn’t built for that. It’s not some random, fleeting token that lives and dies by the daily pump. It’s a movement. A project with depth, culture, and a mission that extends far beyond just numbers on a screen. And that’s why, if you’re here expecting an instant moonshot, you might be looking at it the wrong way.

The truth is, great things take time. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is a legacy. When you’re part of something real something with a strong foundation, an engaged community, and actual plans in motion you don’t need to stress about every dip or pump. You just need to enjoy the ride.

Think about it. POWSCHE has already done what most projects can only dream of. A community that stands strong through cycles, real-world rewards like Dubai trips and Porsche giveaways, and now, a multichain expansion that puts us in front of a massive new audience. We’re not just another “hope and pray” token. We deliver. Always.

So the question is, are you here for the long haul, or are you just looking for a quick flip? Because history shows that the biggest winners in crypto are the ones who see beyond the short term. The ones who plant their flag early, who understand the vision, who recognize that the real wealth isn’t just in the destination it’s in the journey.

And that’s exactly what we’re on right now. A journey that’s only getting started.

CryptoMoonShots,$SPU - the memecoin you DIDN’T see coming - but won’t be able to ignore,Active-Party-8597,128,1739561761.0,"Months ago, I was scrolling through Reddit, drowning in **the same sh\*t over and over**.

* Animal coins
* Trump coins
* Seasonal coins like christmas or soperbowl
* And thousands of rugs and obvious scams

I was **this close** to quitting memecoins forever. Then I found something different.

 

# A TOKEN THAT ACTUALLY HAS A STORY

SPU isn’t another copy-paste dog token. It’s **the first memecoin built around an ACTUAL creative vision.**

* **The dev is DOXXED.** Not just some random anon, but a real artist who’s been working on this for **10 YEARS.**
* **Every character in SPU comes from his handmade sculptures**—crafted from computer scrap, then brought to life in animation. 
* **This isn’t just a token—it’s an animated universe.** TikTok clips are dropping, **YouTube is catching on, and Twitter degens are starting to notice.**
* Everything is based on **organic community growth,** real relationships and real community. No hype, no paid ads. 

I watched the first SPU video, and instead of feeling like I was getting scammed (again), I laughed my ass off. This was **actually fun**.

The power of a **good meme** beats any roadmap, any utility, any influencer.

SPU gets this — except it’s taking it to the **next level**.

✔ **FULLY ORIGINAL IP** – Not a ripoff, **100% unique content**  
✔ **Real art + Cartoons + Meme Energy** – A fusion that’s never been done before  
✔ **COMMUNITY-DRIVEN** – Regular VCs, no insider pump-and-dump sh\*t

 

# Take your chance now

Now you can choose between beeing on the sidelines **watching SPU go viral** and holding some sh\*tcoin that going to zero**.** 

Or you can take the unique opportunity of the current market. While all other projects fall, SPU has held the floor for 2 weeks. Still a very small market cap at around 200k.

Social media platforms and websites silence voices through automated AI moderation. These AI systems are controlled by centralized corporations with no transparency. Big Tech decides what stays and what gets removed, and users have no say in the process.

This is where $AVENCE comes in.

The Solution: AI + Blockchain for Fair & Transparent Moderation

$AVENCE is the first decentralized AI-powered moderation system built entirely on the blockchain. Unlike traditional AI filters that operate in secrecy, Avence brings full transparency and on-chain accountability to content moderation.

Key Features
	•	AI-driven filtering – Detects and removes harmful content in real time.
	•	Blockchain-backed transparency – Every decision is logged on-chain for public verification.
	•	Decentralized review system – Users can challenge AI decisions using governance tokens.
	•	Early adopters = Future whales – The token is still at a micro market cap with high upside potential.

Why $AVENCE Has 100x Potential

The AI market is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. The biggest challenge in AI adoption? Trust and fairness in its decision-making. Governments and businesses need decentralized solutions to ensure ethical AI implementation.

$AVENCE is positioned at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and regulation compliance. Its goal? To become the industry standard for trustless AI content moderation.

Market Potential
	•	Low market cap – Still in early stages, high growth potential.
	•	AI + Blockchain – The strongest narrative in crypto today.
	•	Growing regulatory demand – More companies and governments want transparent AI moderation tools.

Why Buy Now?
	•	Early buyers shape the ecosystem.
	•	Market cap is still under the radar.
	•	Once institutions enter, it’s too late to be early.

**Real Nuke Coin White Paper**

**Introduction:** What is Nuke Coin? Nuke Coin is the brain child of a small group of friends who enjoy the science of Nuclear Technology and Weapons. Nuke Coin is a token on the Solana Network. Have you ever looked into meme coins on DEXScreener? The market is full of rug pulls and scams. This brings us to one of our main goals for Nuke Coin: provide a token that shows the validity of Solana as a leading crypto platform.  Cryptocurrency gives power to the people and not mega entities and Solana has the potential to expand into the cultural zeitgeist in ways that other platforms have not.

Which brings us to Nuke Coin. We are striving for a community-oriented ecosystem where we can educate citizens of the world on nuclear weapons in a way that brings humor to a dark subject. We are politically neutral and do not support any candidates. Utility wise, this token is useless. This is our first project and we intend to support it as long as the world keeps it alive. In a perfect world, this would mean that our token becomes wildly successful enabling us to assign utility, enable staking and keep this project moving!

**Utility:** We understand that tokens, or “memecoins” do not have utility by default. With all crypto, the true value is in what the holders say it is worth. Our vision is to have Nuke Coin serve as a humorous payment method via Solana. Real friends send nuclear weapons to each other and to quote Tyler Durden, "" If you could Nuke anyone, who would you Nuke?"". Owe a friend $20? Nuke their wallet with Nuke Coin! Coworker annoying you about the $2s you owe them for a soda? Send them Nuke Coin and leave their wallet smoking and irradiated!

**Nuke Coin Tokenomics:**

Minted: 10B Tokens

**12%** \- Unknown ICBM has entered our air space. Please seek immediate shelter. (Pre-Sale Air Drops)

Airdrop to 12 random addresses (available to trade, sell at launch)

**15%** Presale advantage to market price – **unsold are burned** (poisoned via radioactive fallout) - Price is a derivative of the year Enrico Fermi built his Pile Reactor!

**20%** – Available for purchase/sell on launch

**12%** \- SLBM Trident II Launch Detected - MIRV Second Strike airdrop to 12 random addresses (MIRV fired 72 hours after launch)

**40%** Nuclear Submarine Movement Detected. 20% of this is vest for two weeks. The other 20% belongs to the Devs.

There are three of us and the divide will be:

·         Dev 1: 10%

·         Dev 2: 5%

·         Dev 3: 5%

 

What about the other 20%?

Nuke Coin is first and foremost a community project. The remaining 20% belongs to the community and will be given away in the form of air drops and other giveaways. **This amount is vested in the Community Wallet.**

 **About the 40%:** We understand the visuals of withholding 40% of the token. However, investigation into how to maintain “control” of a project during the first few weeks of launch with other tokens showed that to prevent rug pulls/snipe/bots a majority of the token must be spoken for. Some communities actually recommended retaining 80% of the tokens for two weeks to combat this and obfuscating this from the community via multi wallets, but that sounds even worse. We are a project of integrity and at the end of the day this is meant to be fun. Destroying the trust we manage to gain is not something we're interested in. The 40% is our attempt to ride the launch and listings on Dexs without crashing out or suffering LP drain. The three devs do own 20% of the project collectively, but the other 80% belongs to the community. Whether that is through buying, trading or receiving air drops (of which there will be many!).

 Keep your eyes on the skies and see you at launch!

 \-Criticality and the Nuke Coin Team.

CryptoMoonShots,The Next Big Thing: REAL Competitive Trading - $RED vs $BLUE,ILikeWeirdHumans,1,1739630003.0,"Memecoin cults are all the rage on Crypto Twitter right now. But why settle for just one when you can have two?

## The Basics

- **Two Tokens:** Choose your favorite—$RED or $BLUE. When the supply of your token hits zero, your side takes the victory and the rewards!
- **Dynamic HP System:** Each token starts with 10B HP (its supply), which can increase to 21B. Every purchase chips away at your rival’s HP while boosting your own.
- **GameMaster in Control:** A smart contract handles it all autonomously—dynamic pricing, ETH redistribution, and price updates based on Uniswap pools for extra strategy.

## What’s in It for You?

- **Community-Driven Rewards:** 70% of every purchase fuels the final reward pool, which returns to the community (unlike other projects who take 80% for themselves 👀).
- **Winner Takes All:** If your token wins, you get a share of the reward pool based on how much you hold. Own 1% of the supply? You’ll take 1% of the prize pool.
- **No Shady Business:** Liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced, and there are no insider wallets or token allocation. 

## More Green Flags?

- Total transparency. No rugs. Ownership renounced for ultimate peace of mind. If you any questions, I'll answer personally.
- Zero trading fees, just a 5% dev fee on GameMaster buys.
- This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s a tactical war where timing and strategy count.

## Ready to Pick a Side?

1️⃣ Head over to [redvblue.xyz](https://redvblue.xyz)

I lookout for bitget score on the token since the high score can indicate a good investment opportunity. This scores is determine using metrics like market trends, community sentiment, and performance. Next i need to check the community support since community is the major driver for meme coin's success. Ii mostly track this activities using platforms like Telegram, Discord, or X.

CryptoMoonShots,How attractive are AI related projects to crypto investors?,minibuddy0,1,1739612799.0,"In the last couple years one of the fastest growing niche in crypto, is the AI space, there's been a lot of new developments and exposure for so many AI related projects. 

The question now is how this benefits users in the web3 space or if it even benefits us at all, if you look at it at the moment, a lot of big tech dominates AI development, and from what we know they keep, control, profits, and even centralize data

  
The direct effect of this is that creators, researchers, and even us users are left with limited ownership or rewards. 

In all of this, I think the good news is that there are many projects that have proposed and are offering solutions to issues like these. 

For example, because of how expensive building AI tools can be and the amount of technical knowledge required, you have projects like MyShell (SHELL) that lets anyone create AI agents, integrate APIs, and bring their AI ideas to life without needing massive resources.

  
Although to be fair, I only found out about this one this week, when my exchange announced the extra reward they are giving to people who trade it on Bitget. Initially, the examples I'd like to use are options like FET that enables autonomous AI agents to interact and transact without intermediaries, or even AGIX with its decentralised marketplace for AI services where developers can create, share, and monetize AI models.

All of these are examples of the solutions I was referring to, but do you think there's a market for them? Would you say crypto users are open to adding projects like these to their portfolio?"

CryptoMoonShots,RAMON: The Most Bullish Meme Launch of 2025 Is Coming to Solana,DesignerSwimming9221,570,1739469715.0,"The crypto world is about to be flipped on its head. RAMON ($RAMON), the most anticipated Solana-based meme coin of the year, is launching on Tuesday, February 11th, backed by an elite network of top-tier investors, venture capitalists, 
and industry powerhouses.

A Movement, Not Just a Token

RAMON isn’t your typical meme coin - it’s a cultural phenomenon. Fueled by unfiltered chaos, relentless engagement, and raw exposure, RAMON is setting a new standard for Web3 communities. With an alter ego known as The Parasite, 
a fully autonomous AI agent, RAMON will call out crypto frauds, disrupt narratives, and inject pure, unfiltered entertainment into the space.

Backing the movement is the Scum Board, an AI-driven accountability system that scrapes X (Twitter) for sentiment data, ranks projects based on their shady activities, and
automatically exposes them to the public. The Parasite, linked directly to the Scum Board, will take things a step further - trash-talking bad actors in real-time and keeping the ecosystem honest.

Heavyweight Backing & Tier 1 CEX Listings

RAMON is not just a meme - it’s a power move. The project has secured support from over 30 major investors, including leading venture capital firms, angel investors, and venture studios. 
In addition, RAMON has confirmed multiple centralized exchange (CEX) listings in the first week, including a Tier 1 CEX on Day 1.

Beyond the listings, RAMON has attracted a stacked roster of KOLs, with Tier 1, 2, and 3 influencers ready to amplify the movement. The project has also forged collaborations with Toby & Brent, and the team’s deep connections in the crypto space include backing from key figures involved in Popcat, Su Deng, SunDog and Chill Guy, some of the biggest memes in recent history.

The hype has already begun. RAMON recently hosted an exclusive 140ft yacht party in Dubai, bringing together some of the biggest names in the space. The backing to this project is massive and there are even celebrity endorsements lined up, though the team is keeping those names under wraps until launch.

Join the Ramon Familia

Community isn’t just an afterthought in RAMON—it’s the foundation. Inspired by classic mafia structures, RAMON introduces the Ramon Familia, an exclusive hierarchical ranking system that rewards the most dedicated members with perks, privileges, and
real-world value.

Ranks include:
- The Boss – Ramon himself, leading the family.
- Underboss & Consigliere – Core leadership overseeing operations.
- Captains & Soldiers – Community ambassadors and moderators ensuring engagement.
- Sicarios – The PvP hitmen of RAMON, driving narrative-fueled burn events.
- The Inner Circle – A private alpha group for RAMON whales, offering insider
opportunities and exclusive perks.

Every rank comes with exclusive merchandise, dynamic NFTs, private access, and community-driven incentives, making membership in the Ramon Familia a true badge of honor.


The Takeover Begins – Be Part of It

RAMON is not here to take part—it’s here to take over. With a bold, AI-driven social movement, relentless community engagement, and heavyweight industry backing, 
this launch is guaranteed to shake up the crypto world.

Don’t just watch from the sidelines—join the movement.

CryptoMoonShots,$PUG Presale heating up. Could this be the next 100x,CemYigit987,526,1739463238.0,"

Rich Pug: The Solana Memecoin with Real Utility and Casino Gaming

The memecoin landscape is evolving, and Rich Pug is leading the charge on Solana with real utility. Unlike other dog-themed tokens with no tangible value, Rich Pug is set to revolutionize the space by introducing over 250+ casino-based games, Staking and much more.

✅Not Just Another Meme Coin

While many memecoins ride the hype wave without substance, Rich Pug distinguishes itself through its casino-based gaming arena. Unlike projects such as Hamster Kombat or Notcoin, which rely on repetitive tap-to-earn mechanics, Rich Pug’s games will be real and interactive, catering to the growing demand for decentralized gaming experiences.

✅Presale and Price Predictions

The Rich Pug presale is already making waves. They successfully raised $72,000, and running in the second stage, it is currently priced at $0.011. With a projected launch price of $0.03, investors are eyeing potential massive gains, especially with the upcoming mega burning event, which could see over 40% of the total supply burned.

Given these factors and the increasing demand for utility-driven memecoins, speculations suggest that Rich Pug could reach anywhere between $1 to $3 during the peak bull run.

✅Competitive Edge and Community Strength

One of the most compelling aspects of Rich Pug is its recognition by top media houses, positioning it as a direct competitor to some of Solana’s leading memecoins, which are currently boasting multi-million-dollar market caps.

However, what truly sets Rich Pug apart is its slow and steady approach to community growth. With an engaged community of over 3,500 members, constant giveaways, and high levels of interaction, it is steadily building a loyal holder base. Unlike randomly trading memecoins on DEXs, Rich Pug provides a structured and promising investment opportunity for those looking for the next 100x gem.

✅The Pug Army: 50+ Ambassadors on a Mission

To amplify its reach, Rich Pug has onboarded over 50 ambassadors, forming a dedicated Pug Army committed to spreading the word about this high-utility memecoin. Their efforts are positioning Rich Pug as a formidable force in the Solana ecosystem.

CryptoMoonShots,"Swisstronik - RWA, AI, Crypto, and Web 3.0 compliance made easy",WhichRadio6124,3,1739559963.0,"Finding a balance between decentralization and legal compliance is one of the main challenges facing blockchain technology as it advances. Many promising projects are unable to be widely adopted because they cannot adhere to strict regulations while protecting user privacy. However, a new generation of hybrid blockchain solutions is beginning to emerge to address this issue and facilitate a seamless integration of compliance and decentralization. Swisstronik and other identity-based hybrid blockchain ecosystems represent a major advancement in this area. Know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance measures are integrated into the Swisstronik platform without endangering decentralization or revealing user data. Businesses can confidently develop decentralized apps (dApps) that respect global regulatory standards and uphold the core principles of blockchain technology by putting these safeguards in place.



Using cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) is one of the most exciting new developments in this area. These methods allow for the verification of user credentials without revealing personal data. These cryptographic solutions, which ensure the privacy of sensitive data while still adhering to legal requirements, are revolutionizing compliance in blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, existing business structures can be easily integrated with hybrid blockchain solutions. Companies can use tools like on-chain identity verification and privacy-preserving data mechanisms to streamline operations and lower compliance costs. This eliminates one of the biggest barriers to adoption of Web 3.0 technologies for traditional industries.



As businesses recognize the potential of decentralized applications and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, there will only be a greater need for privacy-focused, compliant blockchain solutions. Projects can bridge the gap between the Web 3.0 ecosystem and conventional industries by proactively addressing regulatory complexities while maintaining security and decentralization.



To shape the future of a decentralized and compliant digital economy, developers, investors, and companies will need to keep an eye on Swisstronik's innovative blockchain projects.

CryptoMoonShots,THC - Tin Foil Community: The latest memecoin rugpull masterclass - Let's discuss :-),Living_Experience_31,4,1739545395.0,"Alright lads and lasses, gather round for a cautionary tale from the depths of the memecoin trenches. Before we dive in, let’s get one thing straight—this isn’t FUD against the community takeover. If anything, some of you poor sods might actually be able to turn this disaster into something real. If you can resurrect this from the ashes, fair play! But before we celebrate, we need to talk about how we got here in the first place. Understanding these scams is the only way we can stop history from repeating itself. Because let's be honest—THC isn’t the first, and it sure as hell won’t be the last.

Also, full disclosure—I didn’t invest in this myself. I was just watching from the sidelines, popcorn in hand, as the chaos unfolded. It was like witnessing a crypto-themed episode of *Black Mirror* in real-time.

# The Build-Up

It all started with the classic shilling in every crypto subreddit you can imagine. ""New community token!"" ""Get in early!"" ""This is the next 1000x!""—you know the drill. They had a website, a Twitter, a Telegram, the whole shebang. And what was the call to action? ""Join our Telegram to find out more!""

Ah yes, the Telegram—where the magic happens. Or, in this case, where the bots and paid shills gather like a swarm of overly enthusiastic NPCs in an MMO. Sure, there were probably a few real degens in there, but the whole thing reeked of a setup. The way they hyped it, you'd think it was the second coming of Doge himself.

# The Launch

At around 7:30 PM UTC, the CA was released, and from there, it was pure entertainment. Market cap shot up and down like a malfunctioning elevator. But within hours, the inevitable happened: multiple rug pulls.

Turns out, 30% of the supply was owned by the token launchers. *Shocker!* So, in the grand tradition of professional crypto heists, they dumped on the buyers, draining liquidity faster than a Brit downs a pint on a Friday night. It was like watching a train crash in slow motion—horrifying, yet you couldn’t look away.

And who were these masterminds behind the rug? Who knows! Could be some faceless group of Indian or Nigerian scammers running a Telegram farm, some greasy teenagers operating from their mum’s basement, or some middle-aged bloke in a tracksuit living in Dubai off his previous rug-pull winnings. Either way, they were pros at the game.

The result? A peak MC of $1.6 million absolutely obliterated down to around $157k. And yet, people are still bag-holding, praying for a comeback. Bless 'em. The copium levels are off the charts.

# Lessons to Take Away

1. **New launches are a minefield** – If you’re new to crypto, don’t just FOMO in because some Telegram mod says “we go to Valhalla.” Let the hype die down before making a move. Or if you must ape in, grab a tiny bag and DCA instead of going all-in. Or, y’know, just set your money on fire—it’s quicker.
2. **Study the scammers** – The THC team are **pros** at this. If you want to avoid getting rekt, analyse how these scams operate. They follow the same patterns over and over again. It’s basically a Ponzi speedrun.
3. **Look at token distribution** – If one wallet holds a ridiculous percentage, run. Coins like THC make it painfully obvious who’s gonna rug you. If 30% of the supply is in one wallet, you’re not “early,” you’re dinner.
4. **Established memecoins with real communities are your best bet** – Not shilling, but if you’ve been around, you’ve probably seen Powsche mentioned everywhere. Their OG dev is still around, their token distribution isn’t a joke, and their community is actually active across multiple platforms. Contrast that with THC, where the only development was the founders learning how fast they could empty the liquidity pool.
5. **Real projects build, scams don’t** – Powsche, for example, has sent community members to Dubai, given away a Porsche, and even developed a bridge from Solana to Ethereum. THC, on the other hand, built nothing except broken dreams and empty bags. Powsche is around 11 months old now, it's had its ups and downs but the community is second to none.
6. **Plath and Pyrate also seem like real communities** – Again, DYOR, but these are looking much more promising than the next shady rug launch.

# Final Thoughts (Not FUD, Just Facts)

Again, this isn’t about FUDding the community takeover—if anything, that might be the only way for some of you to claw back your losses. Who knows? Maybe you’ll even turn it into something legit. But we have to talk about these scammers so we can all get better at spotting them before they rinse the next batch of newcomers.

I didn’t invest in THC myself, but watching it unfold was like binge-watching a true crime documentary in real-time. Time and time again, I see fresh-faced investors ape into these ""next big things,"" only to get rekt and then have to CTO (Cut Their Losses) just to recover. The same ones who once shouted “jeets will be punished!” end up becoming jeets themselves because they have no other choice. It’s the circle of life, but with more financial ruin.

So, do your own research, avoid obvious scams, and don’t get seduced by Telegram hype. And for the love of all things holy, if a token looks like a scam, smells like a scam, and acts like a scam—it’s probably a scam.

Stay safe out there, degens. And as always, cheers for reading!"

CryptoCurrencies,"Change my mind, Polkadots JAM upgrade is the greatest invention in web3 since smart-contracts",bitcoinovercash,4,1738890505.0,"

Yes price action is bad. But I’m talking technology.

Upgrades overview:
—> JAM can host and execute any and all contract-languages (Move, Plutos, EVM, Rust…) all of them 
—> JAM can verify transactions in parallel and they are actually verified on-chain, not off-chain in an L2
—> transaction latency within cores will be 5-50ms
—> JAM can dynamically scale up or down a smart-contract or blockchains computation resources, based on its real time demand
—> JAM uses highly programmable JAM services that can host things outside of just smart-contract languages and entire blockchains. It can run the entire chatGPT AI model, python scripts, C++

Upgrade Summary:
Instead of trying to make one blockchain faster, JAM works by running multiple processing units (“cores”) that execute transactions in parallel. And these cores are all fully on-chain not some off-chain L2 or Hydra-Head roll up. This means no congestion, near-instant execution (~5-50ms), and automatic scaling whenever demand increases—just like cloud computing. 

Unlike Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano, which all hit bottlenecks when too many people use them, JAM simply adds more power as needed, making it infinitely scalable.

CryptoCurrencies,"Thinking of trying a trading bot, any thoughts?",LidiaSelden96,0,1738673184.0,"I’ve been in crypto for like 2 years now mostly trading on Solana and sometimes on ETH. I’ve always done stuff manually using price alerts simple charts and DEX trackers. It’s been fine but I feel like I miss out on fast trades especially with new tokens and quick pumps.

I’ve been thinking of trying a trading bot to catch better entries without having to stare at charts all day. Found one on [https://bananagun.io/](https://bananagun.io/) and it looks cool but I’ve never used a bot before so not really sure how it works. Does it actually help with sniping and fast trades? Is it hard to set up with wallets and DEXs?

If anyone’s tried it or any other bots let me know how it’s been for you. Just wanna see if it’s worth it. Thanks!"

Can someone else review and see what conclusion you come to? I don't want to create FUD unnecessarily, it would be odd for them to realize such high losses. Maybe they are transferring to another wallet?

It does appear there are a lot of transactions to Coinbase. Are they moving everything to another wallet? There are so many small and large dollar transactions that its very hard to follow. Millions sent to an address, just to be sent to another, and another and another and appears to end up in a whale Coinbase account? Are they distributing coins to themselves? All questions and speculation, hoping those with more experience analyzing transactions can come to a conclusion."

CryptoCurrencies,Liquidated my entire account in half an hour,TheRealJR9,50,1738105612.0,"Humour tag because I'm a laughing stock right now.

I'm actually completely new to this. I'm still learning, but I started getting a couple of good trades in a row (not in this though). I then put in a fairly large one without any S/L, and it went in the other direction. Instead of pulling out early (nice) I left it and waited for it to change direction, only for it to not happen and then my account got liquidated.

Instead of ending it there, I funded the account again, got like 2 good trades in a row and proceeded to liquidate the account again from doing the exact same thing as above.

I'm not here to hope for pity, I just need people to tell, and, hopefully, advice too. I feel like this is good, there is no better teacher than experience, especially when it's yours. My friend that this exact thing happened to went through something similar, but since I was getting a few good trades in I thought I was better and it could never happen to me.

The 2 losses are both the ones that liquidated me."

I did my 9-5, went to the gym (almost skipped because I was so excited), came home and finally had the chance to begin my first evening trading crypto. 

  
I got all my wallets created, security phrases stored properly, got BullX going, watched some videos once more to refresh my mind, and decided it was time to purchase some SOL and go to work. 

  
I purchase SOL and get it on my Phantom wallet. I do a small test transfer from Phantom wallet to BullX wallet (SOL) - SUCCESSFUL. Okay, perfect. Lets do this one more time, but with enough money to get my feet wet for the night. Same process - just copy and paste the wallet link from BullX into Phantom and send my SOL. SUCCESSFUL. I check refresh BullX - nothing. I refresh a few times. Nope. I take a break hoping if I give it a few minutes, considering how weird SOL has been, then hopefully it will show up soon. 

  
TWO HOURS LATER and still nothing. I begin to look into forums, joined live streams, googling - there is nothing on this really. The only thing I got was about a dozen scammers trying to get me to click on their website to resolve the issue. Ok, I began to investigate the transaction details on Solscan. I compared the previous successful transaction to the second transaction.. after several minutes I finally found the issue. 

  
SOME HOW one capitalized letter became lower case.......... how tf does this happen when copying/ pasting the link from wallet to wallet. This has honestly just taken all the excitement and ambition out of it. I'm not giving up, but I'm not sure I feel the same about this coming into it as I did prior. 

  
Any thoughts are appreciated. "

Secondly I lose a small percentage with a bank transfer fee from UBS then I also lose more with the conversion rate from CHF to EUR when loading money onto the card. 

Then when I spend EUR in Geneva where I live I loose even more on the conversion rate from EUR back to CHF when I want to go shopping

Crypto_com,POTENTIAL LAWSUIT AGAINST CRYPTO_COM: Cypro_com Visa Card Charged More Than What I Paid To The Merchant,annk4131215,0,1739480493.0,"I went to a restaurant (which does not accept gratuity and tips since it is like a fast-food restaurant. I paid $17.00 CAD for food. I used my Crypto\_com Ruby Steel Visa Card, which was added to my Apple Pay. 

I have attached images; as you can see, the receipt says $17.00 CAD and Apple Pay shows I paid $17.00 CAD. Also, this restaurant doesn't require a tip or a signature. Whatever you pay at the cashier is the final bill, and that final amount is authorized already.

When I logged in to the Crypto\_com app, the transaction showed $20.40 CAD (precisely 20% more than the initial authorized amount of $17.00). I contacted Crypto\_com support on the app. They told me to contact the merchant. I was already eating food at the restaurant, so I went to the cashier and asked them if they would charge me extra. He said, **""No, we did not charge the above amount; we only charged you $17.00, and $17.00 CAD was authorized.""** The merchant showed me the receipt, and I have attached the image of the receipt below.

Crypto\_com's customer support said that the merchant authorized an extra amount. Still, the merchant says they did not. So either Crypto\_com authorized an extra amount without my authorization, or Crypto\_com's partner bank in Canada, *Digital Commerce Bank (DCBank)*, authorized a higher amount in the transaction without my authorization.

I found an article on the Crypto\_com website; the link is below:

https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/4283259-what-are-the-charges-fees-and-limits-associated-with-the-crypto-com-visa-card

However, since the merchant is not authorizing a higher amount, this could lead to a class action lawsuit against Crypto\_com, *Digital Commerce Bank (DCBank)*, or both. If you are experiencing the same problem, please write your story version and upload receipts and transaction confirmations under this thread.

Crypto_com,Noted Cronos Price Differences - Crypto.com vs. Others,JTBoner1,1,1739381788.0,"Hello all,

 

Just wanted to pass the message onto the community that this morning I noticed that Crypto.com actually charges more for their Cronos (CRO) Token on their platform than the others. The price of Crypto.com was generally $0.002 to $0.004 CAD higher than other platforms like Coinbase and CoinMarketCap.

 

Later I noticed that this actually happens to many other tokens sold on their platform and it seems like some shady business is happening by taking advantage of a lack of attention to detail. With the millions of transactions occurring on a daily basis, this most likely equates to tens of millions of dollars a year getting skimmed from people by fractionally raising the price.  Has anyone else noticed this discrepancy yet or is it just me?"
Crypto_com,Unresolved issue regarding Magaverse coin retrieval and refund request,SignificantMark6376,1,1739368213.0,"On January 8th, I purchased Magaverse Coin at a low price using the Phantom app. That same day, I mistakenly transferred the entire amount to [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/), believing the token was supported on the platform. This was based on a Magaverse price chart I found on Google on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) website. I take full responsibility for this misunderstanding.

Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately contacted support, and I was informed that I needed to pay 100 USC (\~$150 CAD) for the retrieval of my funds. I made this payment in good faith, expecting a resolution. However, despite multiple follow-ups throughout January, I never received any updates or access to my coins.

On January 16th, Magaverse reached its all-time high, yet I was unable to access my funds because [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) never completed the retrieval. As the value started to drop, I still had no control over my assets, despite waiting for weeks. When it became clear that the retrieval was pointless due to the complete loss of value, I contacted support again on January 24th, requesting a refund of the retrieval fee.

Since January 24th until today, February 12th, I have received no response and no resolution to this matter. Given that I had no access or control over my funds due to Crypto.com's failure to process the retrieval, I am requesting a full refund of the retrieval fee (100 USC / \~$150 CAD) and a reimbursement of the amount I originally invested in Magaverse, as I was prevented from managing my funds due to Crypto.com’s inaction.

This issue has remained unresolved for over a month, which is completely unacceptable."

CryptoIndia,Buy/Sell on Karsa P2P as an Early User,stablecoindev,0,1738874645.0,"Hi r/CryptoIndia! I'm Shahryar, the founder of [Karsa](https://gokarsa.com): we’re a YC-funded, secure P2P exchange, focused on dollar access for everyday people in regions like India. We just launched last week and would love to have the community come onboard to trade P2P on our platform (*+ we have a bonus program specifically for you all!*)

**Why Karsa**

* Most exchanges focus only on traders, while many legitimate businesses and professionals in India struggle to access USD efficiently. Our users include folks in fintech, startup founders, and businesses who need stablecoins to hold or move money—not just traders—this is a much safer set of buyers, with significantly less risk of fraud.
* Security is our absolute priority. Unlike larger exchanges that optimize for user numbers, we’ve personally verified (and spoken with) every buyer and seller on our platform. We’d rather have fewer buyers/sellers that feel safe doing more volume than letting everyone in. We can never 100% mitigate fraud risks, but we’re putting higher safeguards than any other platform.
* We use smart contracts for escrow, and we handle all payment verification / disputes directly with you - no need to manage any individual chats with buyers.

**Coming Soon**

We're expanding rapidly with features focused on practical usage:

* Card services for spending and easy off-ramping
* Virtual US bank accounts for sending/receiving payments and faster/cheaper freelancer payouts
* Access to US Treasury yields for your stablecoin holdings
* Currently only available on web but mobile app on the way soon

**Bonus Program for Early Adopters**

***We're currently running a bonus program for sellers joining our platform—reach out to me for more details.*** I'm personally available to walk anyone through our onboarding process and help you get set up - whether you're interested in buying or selling (you can get started at https://gokarsa.com/deposit). Feel free to reach out to me on telegram (sherooberoo) or on Whatsapp at +18178810943 with any questions, issues, feedback, etc."
CryptoIndia,Questions regarding crypto tax and Binance transaction statement,clueless_robot,4,1739689373.0,"Now that Binance is FIU registered, I decided to go file my crypto transactions. I have a few questions.

1) Can I just file for this financial year i.e. 2024-2025? Or do I have to go back and file for past years and pay any penalty (if any)? Can the past years be forgiven? If past years need to be filed, how far into the past do I need to go?

2) I downloaded a comprehensive transaction statement from Binance. Do I just give this to my CA to figure things out or would I have to do math by myself? I've used futures, simple earn and multiple such products. I've even sent small amounts to the Web3 wallet in the Binance ecosystem.

3) ClearTax has a tool where you just upload the CSV and they do everything for you. Has anyone used it and is it reliable and accurate?

4) Let's say I file my tax on crypto but it's wrong. It's either more or less as per whatever records the government has. What happens in both situations where I've paid more or less than what I should have"

CryptoIndia,Question on Crypto Mining in India and tax Implications,Realistic-Bath-761,8,1739632679.0,"Hello All,

A group of us are exploring setting up mining rigs (ASIC based) that are capable of unto 60GH/s to mine a collection of Alt coins that can later be converted to BTC. We plan to setup solar power uptown 40KW. We do however have some questions on taxation in India. Understand that mining itself is still legal . Here are the questions

1. When the mined alt coins are swapped for BTC is there a tax needs to be paid to the government.

2. If answer to 1 is no, then when the BTC is transferred to our wallet in CoinDCX, the Indian government (under current law) considers mined BTC Fair Market Value as  Zero, and the tax (30%) will be on the total value of the bitcoin. Does the government allow cost of acquisition of such Bitcoin to be offset (cost of the miner Rigs, solar installation depreciation or electricity costs). 

3. Has anyone actually setup mining farms in India with solar power and based on their experience after taxes does it make sense to mine in India

  
We may also look at opportunity to setup the mining in other country if it is not profitable in India but then transferring the bitcoins to India and getting money out to bank gets a bit complicated.

  
Would appreciate your experienced comments"

Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoIndia/s/ADNOpfeUuO

Where users/traders are asked to connect their web3 wallet to a random website shared by scammer. There are many websites that goes by the links like bnbverify.com, binanceverify.com, bnbverify.io and many more. Please be careful out there. Once you connect your wallet they will drain your wallet by using drainer scripts/bots. Before you guys connect your web3 wallet to link kindly verify the web link which you're accessing at below given links

1) https://www.binance.com/en/official-verification
2) https://www.bnbchain.org/en/official-verification

And also reminder to all crypto traders, YOUR ASSETS ARE GENUINE IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR YOU ON CEX TO DO ACTIVITY AND IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL, NO NEED TO CONNECT TO ANY VERIFICATION LINKS. 

Tainted assets will be marked immediately by cex's before depositing it in your wallet."
CryptoIndia,Do I have to declare Pi Coins that have been mined in ITR?,ArvindCoronawal69,3,1739653893.0,"I have been mining Pi coins since 2021, and with the potential listing on Feb 20, do I have to declare them for FY 2025-26? I have no experiene in filing ITR."
CryptoIndia,Is Investing in Crypto in India a Smart Choice?,NecessaryGur9654,14,1739613145.0,"Is there anything favorable about investing in Crypto, particularly through Binance? First, you purchase USDT via P2P, where you typically lose around 5-10% due to margin fees. After that, you need to achieve a return on investment (ROI) that surpasses what you could earn from more stable alternatives like fixed deposits or mutual funds, all while considering the 30% tax on crypto profits. Additionally, any losses you incur can only be offset against your gains. Even if you manage to make a decent profit, converting that profit into cash isn’t straightforward; you’ll have to navigate the P2P route again. Here, you not only face seller margins but also the risk of your bank account being frozen or subjected to a lien if you receive funds deemed ""tainted"" from a seller. Moreover, declaring your earnings and dealing with potential inquiries from the tax authorities is a daunting prospect. I was beginning to take this investment seriously, but it’s becoming clear that there are significant drawbacks to investing in crypto in India."

CryptoIndia,[Beginner] Need to buy Crypto P2P,MasterAlan101,2,1739607159.0,"I'm relatively new to the crypto world, I have gotten some knowledge through reading various articles online.

I have set up my wallets on metamask, trustwallet and I want to buy some crypto. I don't want to open an account with any exchange because I want to stay anonymous and not get taxed (the whole idea behind crypto).

CryptoIndia,My Take on WazirX Rebalancing & Fund Recovery! 🚀,Some_Piece_8270,8,1739552116.0,"There’s been some buzz around WazirX’s rebalancing and fund recovery plan. I have tried to understand the rebalancing process and here’s what I’ve understood:

 **📊 An Example:**

Imagine you had ₹1,00,000 in your WazirX account on July 18, 2023. After the hack, WazirX can recover 85% of your tokens. That means your portfolio is worth ₹85,000 as of January 17, 2025 (the rebalancing date).

**But here’s the important part:** You’re not getting ₹85,000 in cash. You’ll get crypto tokens, and their value will depend on market prices when you’re paid, i.e., after the scheme is approved.

**Example of How It Works:**

1️⃣ Let’s say you hold 1 BTC. On Jan 17, 2025, BTC was ₹30 lakh. If by payout day, BTC jumps to ₹32 lakh, you’ll get BTC at that **higher price**, meaning your recovery amount increases with the market.

2️⃣ If there’s a **bull ru**n around payout time, your 85% recovery could even become 110% or more! 🚀📈 (Of course, it could go the other way if the market dips.)

**💡Bottom Line:**

You’re getting back 85% of your original portfolio in crypto, adjusted to the market price at payout.

💯**My Take:** I think this approach is fair and transparent. If we say YES to the Scheme, we can finally recover our funds and move forward. ✅🚀"

CryptoIndia,We are taxed triple on top of 1% TDS and no loss set off.,ProfessorTricky1422,32,1739514719.0,"Binance and now Bybit have been fined billions for not collecting GST on trading fees. They demand GST on fees, yet we can't even deduct these fees when calculating taxable profits. This results in a flat 30% tax on profits, plus fees and GST on fees—tripple taxation at its finest.

They want us to work like slaves for fiat—taxing and inflating it before spending. Then, they hit us again with GST when we spend it, while making it difficult to use alternatives like DEXs or Bitcoin, where they can’t collect GST.

Well I am voting yes. Why? Because i am tired of this bullshit and just want whatever I can get so that I can get it over with. Why I dont want to fight the case? I have been going to the court for a property case for the last 15 years. Cases take time, money and lots of energy. Anyone can drag a case in court for years if they have a good lawyer and Nischal has a legal team. They will drag the case and use our money for the legal battle against us. 
If I fight a case, I will have to pay the lawyer, go to court, waste my time.. All this with no guarantee of winning.
If I take what I am getting, I will have something in my hand and can keep fightingbfor the reat if I want to. Also I can use the money I will get from restructuring to invest and cover my losses.

Its just a more sensible thing to say Yes."
CryptoIndia,Why do u think India discouraging crypto by imposing brutal tax rule like no loss setoff.,ProfessorTricky1422,8,1739520977.0,"Is it really because they care about the high risk and us losing money, or is it because they fear losing the 18% GST on our hard-earned already-taxed income—money they can’t tax further if we lose it in crypto instead of spending it on Indian goods (18% GST) or even higher-taxed imported items? Then further this same money circulate indifinetly in Indian economy to be taxed indefinetly. But this will be over when we lose it or hodl it on bitcoin like Michael Saylor."

CryptoIndia,Indian Crypto Scene is doomed for failure,Remote-Dare2254,44,1739461734.0,"In my experience, Mudrex and Zebpay are the only two exchanges that allow you to withdraw crypto to an external wallet. 

Zebpay charges are absurd. I had put 25K I had to withdraw XRP thrice seperately because the maximum withdrawal limit was $100 a day. Everytime I withdraw I need to pay a withdrawal fee of 1XRP. XRP is already marked up by 8-10% to begin with.

Mudrex keeps changing their banking partners every week. I put 1.35L on it and bought USDT after all deductions etc the USDT credited was 1.25L. if you need to withdraw from mudrex, you need to do some verification. I did it and it got rejected. Hence I'm not able to withdraw it to an external wallet. The only option that I have is to withdraw to my bank account where they deduct the 1% tds for no mistake of mine. I called up the customer Support and the person told me that I can hold it in my account and sell when the price goes higher for USDT. 🤦‍♂️ These people have no idea what they are doing.

This is why I really miss WazirX. They gave instant withdrawals atleast. Their integration with Binance was super smooth. 

Crypto in India is doomed. The govt is only interested in taxing this. They provide zero support! Robbing a bank like Mallya is easier in India."

CryptoIndia,New to Mining – Need Advice 🫶🏻,SquareClean5383,3,1739502169.0,"Hey everyone,

I’m new to mining and planning to set up my first small mining operation ( 3 machines ). After some research, I’ve decided to go with Antminer S19 (or a newer model like S19 Pro/S21). However, I have a few questions and would love to get insights from experienced miners in this community:



1️⃣ Choosing the Right Miner – Antminer S19 Pro or Something Newer?

•	I’m looking at 3x Antminer S19 Pro (110 TH/s),     but is it still a profitable choice in 2025?

•	Should I go for something newer like Antminer S21 Pro?

•	If you own any of these, how is your profitability and efficiency?

2️⃣ Where to Buy Genuine ASIC Miners?

•	What are the most trusted sources for purchasing miners? 

•	Has anyone bought from Nexton Mining India? Is it legit and reliable?




3️⃣Profitability – What’s Your Experience?

•	How profitable is mining right now with ASICs?

•	What’s your average daily earnings after electricity costs?

•	If you’re mining on solar, how much have you saved on power bills?

•	How long does it take to break even on your investment?



I’d really appreciate your insights and experiences! If you’re already mining,

Cryptozoology,Would the Supergiant Goblin Sharks from the Gulf of Mexico be considered a type of cryptid?,Galactic_Idiot,472,1739577658.0,"Despite their extreme elusiveness, goblin sharks have been known to western science since 1898. And for over two centuries, these sharks were not known to exceed around 4 meters.

This all changed, though, on the 25th of July 2000, when an enormous, likely female goblin shark was hauled up by commercial fishermen off the gulf of mexico, having become entangled in the fishing line attached to one of their crab traps. The shark was likely already dead by the time it came to the surface; the crew had dissected the shark, and discarded all of its remains, except its jaws, which supposedly they still possess to this day. 

But this Goliath wasn't some one-time fluke; another huge, verified female goblin shark was captured off the southeast gulf, this time trapped in a trawling net, on the 19th of April 2014. Unlike the 2000 shark, this one was well alive when found. After taking a few pictures, it would be released by the fishermen, where it swam its way back down to the depths.

The sheer size of these goblin sharks cannot be understated; the upper estimates for both sharks has them at over 6 meters in length – behind only the basking and great white sharks as the longest lamniformes in the world. One paper from 2019 states that the maximum length of the 2000 shark may have been up to 7 meters; greater than even the longest verified great white sharks, though likely not nearly as massive (though when I read the paper, it seemed the 7m measurment was mentioned out of pocket, with no explanation or apparent citation. Unless I missed something in the paper, i don't think this size estimate should be taken too seriously).

One thing I think is important to note is that an exceptionally large, but not quite supergiant goblin shark was trawled off the coast of Taiwan on the 13th of June 2023. Unlike the supergiants, this shark was able to be properly studied, and was measured at 4.7 meters in length, making her the world’s largest goblin shark to be scientifically examined. It's likely that a major contributor in her exceptional size was due to being pregnant with a whopping six pups; however, when the 2000 fishing crew dissected the supergiant they had caught, they found she had an empty gut, and zero pups in her.

Perhaps what is most fascinating, though, is that goblin sharks of this size are not just known exclusively from the gulf of mexico, but these two sharks are also the only goblin sharks to ever be found in the gulf. This ushers a lot of speculation about the life history and affinities of these sharks:

Could these goblin sharks represent a population unique to at least the northern Gulf of Mexico? Could they perhaps be a completely new species of goblin shark? If they are a unique population/species, what other features, adaptations and behaviors (aside from size) might these sharks possess? What caused these goblin sharks to become so much larger than those found everywhere else in the world? What are the males of this goblin shark population like? Are they also uniquely large? 

And this is where the question of them being a possible cryptid comes in – because unfortunately, none of these questions can be answered. With scientists having been unable to observe either shark in the flesh, and none having been seen since for over a decade, these supergiant goblin sharks of the gulf of mexico have been complete enigmas, and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future. While nobody is contesting the validity of these sharks, the only thing that anyone has to even just verify their existence are the very few pictures taken of the two sharks. This is also why the size estimates for them are so “wide;” you can only get so precise with a few unprofessional photos.

But I'm no cryptozoologist. So I'm not sure whether the supergiant goblin sharks are true cryptids. But I suppose that's why I came here to ask yall about it. To anyone who read all this, thanks for your time :)

Cryptozoology,The link between the Eurasian wildmen and the color red,Mister_Ape_1,5,1739649464.0,"Until the late 20th century it was theorized the Eurasian wildmen were reluct Homo neanderthalensis. Others even thought they were Homo erectus.

But finding out we were able to reproduce with Neanderthals and Denisovans, and Denisovans were able to reproduce with Erectus, made a huge hole in this theory.

Now we know the only ones who could have survived are the very primitive ones such as Homo floresiensis and Paranthropus.

The others would have turned into a new ethnic human group with more introgression by the Neolithic or even earlier. And the more time passed, the least extra introgression they would have had, because everytime some Homo sapiens sapiens mixed with one of them, they would have introduced into themselves a bit more of us, and they would have lost a bit of their previous selves. And since if they still exist they still mix with the locals, then if they still had significant extra introgression, even the locals would have had some extra introgression themselves by mixing with the wildmen. We know it is not so.

This means the Eurasian wildmen of recent times have to be human, however some may not be just feral humans. A basic feral human is not ethnically distinct than local people, is just someone who was abandoned. They do not have a dustinct, hunter gathering culture, they are just hunans with no culture at all.

There is a reason to believe the Eurasian wildmen are more than mere feral humans. Sometimes they could have been some ancient ethnic groups who had to hide to survive the newcomers. Almasti from Caucasus, the wildman of Central Asia, Mongolian Almas and even the Yeren from Central China, (which in origin was human, then in the 20th century the name was used for a sudden appearence of brown bears in Shennongjia forest) all had dark skin and RED OR REDDISH BROWN hair. This is not a baseless idea because reddish or ""camel color"" is the hair color of DEAD BODIES, not only of bears or humans in bear pelts seen from a distance for a short while. Dead bodies do not run away and can be stripped from pelts if they wear them. Yet we have this...

Dead body 1

Gansu, 1940

We could see that the 'wildman' was already shot dead and laid on the roadside. The body was still supple and the stature very tall, approximately 2 metres. The whole body was covered with a coat of thick greyish-RED hair which was very dense and approximately onecunlong. Since it was lying face-down, the more inquisitive of the passengers turned the body over to have a better look. It turned out to be a mother with a large pair of breasts, the nipples being very red as if it had recently given birth. The hair on the face was shorter. The face was narrow with deep-set eyes, while the cheek bones and lips jutted out. The scalp hair was roughly one chi long and untidy.

Dead body 2

Mongolia, 1980

1980, a worker at an experimental agricultural station, operated by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences at Bulgan, encountered the dead body of a wildman: ""I approached and saw a hairy corpse of a robust humanlike creature dried and half-buried by sand. I had never seen such a humanlike being before covered by CAMEL COLOUR brownish-yellow short hairs and I recoiled, although in my native land in Sinkiang I had seen many dead men killed in battle .... The dead thing was not a bear or ape and at the same time it was not a man like Mongol or Kazakh or Chinese and Russian. The hairs of its head were longer than on its body"" (Shackley 1983, p. 107).

Dead body 3

Kabardino Balkaria, 1939

Armed with a stick, I turned it over on all sides and, sitting on my heels, I examined it closely. The head was enveloped in a whole mane of very long hair which, in the living state, probably reached to the waist. The hair was very tangled and matted with thistles. This mane was so thick that, when I turned the head, it remained in the air, as on a cushion. That is why I was not able to discern the form of the skull. However, its dimensions were those of a human skull. The forehead was receding. This spot is very prominent (points to the eyebrows). The nose is small and turned up. It had no root, and was as though pushed into the face. It was the nose of a monkey. The cheeks were prominent, like those of a Chinese. The lips were not those of a man. Rather, they were thin and straight, as in monkeys. I did not see the teeth, as the lips were pressed firmly together. The chin was not as in man, but was rounded and heavy. The ears were human; one was torn, the other intact. The eyes were strongly slanted, with the apertures directed downward and outward. I do not know the color of the eyes. The eyelids were closed, and I did not raise them. The skin was BLACK (this was from Caucasus, so he was mixed with African Ottoman escaped slaves, skin is actually brown not black elsewhere), and covered with dark REDDISH-brown hair. The hair was absent around the eyes and on the upper parts of the cheeks. The cheeks themselves and the ears were covered with short hair. On the neck and the chin the hair was longer.

Those people had to be in most of Eurasia as a large Paleolithic Eurasian group with a mix of African or Oceanian, West Eurasian and East Eurasian traits. But then, as the modern groups expanded after the Last Glacial Maximum, they were reduced in numbers and separated in small communities isolated on the mountains. So they gradually mixed with their respective culturally modern neighbors, but also retained common characteristics found in specimen from Caucasus to Mongolia if not even China and East Siberia.

A Mongolian Almas would likely plot the closer to a Mongolian rather than to a Caucasian Almasti, but the two wildmen would still have shared genes no other group would have from the Paleolithic group they descend from.

If this has to logically be a 95% human group, what is it like ? Which genetic populations originated it ? Caucasians, Central Asians and Mongols are 90% black haired and 9% brown haired, they have basically no red hair, and yet they are light skinned."

If you wanna act disrespectful, condescendant or sarcastic, just ignore this post.**



Hi dear cryptozoology enthusiasts, how are you ? Today I need your help finding more informations about an african cryptid called the ""Serpenti"".

Context : was reading one of my cryptozoology-related books titled ""Le bestiaire énigmatique de la cryptozoologie - Du Yéti au calamar géant"" by Benoît Grison (I dunno if there's an english languaged edition for this one). In his chapter dedicated to debunking african cryptids, he took a look at a cryptid located in the Guinea-Bissao (Bijagos, Formosa Island).

  
That cryptid would be called the ""Serpenti"" and would have been seen by a guide called Patrick Sébile several times in the 90s. It's described as very long (3.5 to 4 meters long) with a head like an otter. The animal was floating on its back, again like an otter, before diving. People in the region claimed to know the ""Serpenti"" too, and claimed it was not a manatee nor an african otter (*Aonyx capensis*). Some authors considered some sort of tropical seal.

  
That's all I have, and I cannot seem to find anything about the ""Serpenti"" on the internet. Very curious, especially when Benoît Grison ends his chapter by saying the cryptid is still seen by locals nowadays.

  
Did you hear about this one ? What are your thoughts ?"
Cryptozoology,Beebe's untouchable fish,Jonnyleeb2003,45,1739488951.0,"These in my opinion are some of the most plausible cryptids. In the 1930s, William Beebe went down in the ocean in a bathysphere and documented several fish. Out of all the fish he documented, 5 of them have never been confirmed to exist. One of them even appears to be a misidentified comb jellyfish. Another he described as a species of giant dragonfish. These are some of the most plausible cryptids in my opinion, because the ocean is a big place, but it does beg the question, why have these fish never been seen since? It's speculated they may have gone extinct since being documented by Beebe, meaning only 1 person saw these fish, before they went extinct. What are your thoughts?"
Cryptozoology,Could belemnites still be around? As another giant squid species.,Turbulent-Name-8349,22,1739500753.0,"Not really cryptozoology but, since people are asking about modern trilobites. What about modern belemnites?

""Belemnites are an extinct order of squid-like cephalopods that existed from the Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous, and possibly the Eocene."" Extremely common Mesozoic fossils. ""The largest belemnite known, would have measured up to 3.11 metres in total body length.""

Which brings us to the bigfin squid. Recently discovered, we can't even tell if the juveniles are a similar species to the adults, no adult has ever been captured. Total length  4 to 8 metres, with some estimates up to 12 metres (yes, you read that correctly) due to very long arms and tentacles. ""Uniquely among cephalopods, the arms and tentacles were of the same length and looked identical (similar to extinct belemnites)"".

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfin_squid

(Caveat, the body is much shorter than the tentacles, weight is very much less than the giant squid)."
Cryptozoology,"Are macaques a possible cryptid from Northeastern China, Inner Manchuria and Korean peninsula ? About the supposedly extinct macaque species of northern East Asia",Mister_Ape_1,21,1739468140.0,"*Macaca anderssoni* Schlosser, 1924 is a fossil macaque found in East Asia (Schlosser, 1924, Delson, 1980, Pan and Yanzhang, 1995, Jablonski, 2002). In China, the large-sized *Macaca* specimens from the Early Pleistocene (ca. 2.6–0.8 Ma) have been identified as belonging to this species.

The holotype of *M. anderssoni* (PMU-M3651), a nearly complete face and palate from the Early Pleistocene of Mianchi, Henan Province, is remarkable in terms of its potential for interpreting phylogenetic relationships.

*M. anderssoni* is phylogenetically related to the *sinica* group (especially *M. assamensis*, *M. thibetana*, and *M. arctoides*). The populations of the *sinica* group were distributed in northern China during the Early Pleistocene. Currently, the populations of the *sinica* group are not distributed in northern East Asia, while those of the *fascicularis* group are.

Here the dispersal patterns of the *sinica* and *fascicularis* groups, and *M. leonina* are illustrated referring to the hypotheses by Delson ([1980](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajp.23142#ajp23142-bib-0010)), Fa ([1989](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajp.23142#ajp23142-bib-0014)), and Tosi et al. ([2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajp.23142#ajp23142-bib-0052)), except for entrances of the three major rivers.

[Excavations of Pleistocene fossil macaques have been reported from northern China and the Korean Peninsula](https://preview.redd.it/m8t1v7gntxie1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86ac8bfc688ae6160565beaf200b5b65ccf6355)

Rhesus macaques have the widest geographic ranges of any non-human primate, occupying a great diversity of altitudes. This species may be found in grasslands, woodlands, and in mountainous regions up to 2,500 m (8,200 ft) in elevation.

**A population of rhesus macaques in the Taihang mountains on the Henan-Shanxi border is probably the northernmost population of the species**. A more northerly population north of Beijing was locally extirpated in 1988.

Could the rhesus macaque still be a living species in modern day Northeast China, Inner Manchuria and the Korean peninsula ?

Can a local cryptid be identified with it ?

By the way, even though it is off topic to this post, I would like to point out it is not entirely true Mongolic people did not ever meet any non human primate before the expansion of the Mongol Empire.

Proto Mongolic steppe nomads, at the time their Proto Turkic close relatives lived in current Mongolia and did not already migrate westward toward West Eurasia, lived between current Inner Manchuria and Inner Mongolia.

[In 200 AD, the Xianbei and the Wuhuan, the descendants of the Donghu, were Proto Mongolic tribes living in Inner Mongolia and Northeast China](https://preview.redd.it/g9l9fxzpwxie1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc006ca39547b50d90f8179de962dc49d71b1e0)

Note, by comparing this picture to the first one, how the Proto Mongolic people are really close to the most northeastern Macaca fossils from Pleistocene and quite close to the most northeastern areas inhabited by Macaca mulatta until recent times.

Even then, macaques have basically NOTHING to do with the Almas legend, even if sometimes Mongolic people could have misidentified large macaques walking on 2 legs for the Almas itself since they would have rarely seen a macaque at all.

The actual reason I wanted to show this territorial overlap is the attitude of the Chinese people to compare non Han, barbarian populations to non human primates found in the same area. People from southern East Asia were compared to gibbons, Malaysians to orangutans, but the steppe people were compared to the macaque, which is not known to inhabit the Eurasian steppe. 

While it is said it was because the macaque has light colored fur and the steppe nomads had lighter pigmentation, compared to the Han, due to West Eurasian admixture, it is also true macaques did actually live in part of the grasslands territories of the nomads in the past. The comparison between steppe barbarians and macaques highlights the presence of Macaca mulatta in northern continental areas, way northward than any other already known, living non human primate."

CryptoTechnology,Biggest security issue with iOS hot wallets?,littelfish,15,1739243702.0,"Seems that no one really brings this one up, but isn't the biggest attack vector the fact that there is a person / team that is able to release updates for these hot wallets? Obviously, at the end of it, even though the source code is available on GitHub  and open source, that doesn't matter one bit, as someone is still taking this code and running the build scripts and then publishing the new version to the app store.

There is nothing stopping said individual from making some uncommitted changes locally before building and releasing a new version of the app (so not visible publicly on GitHub, etc.). These changes could purposefully introduce any number of malicious behaviours into the app, such as 1) deterministic private key generation for new wallets or 2) an inconspicuous private key logging mechanism or 3) have all transaction signing simply send to addresses that this individual owns. Effectively draining users' funds until people realize and the app gets rolled back or taken down. Even an hour of time with a malicious version out there is enough to cause significant financial loss.

This is my biggest fear with hot wallets. The more popular they get, and the more people are using them to store a large amount of bitcoin, cumulatively, the more tempting this becomes to the individual with the ability to roll out app updates. It just needs to get into the wrong hands.

Some ways in which this could be mitigated:

1. If Apple would allow users to disable automatic updates only for certain individual apps (such as hot wallets for example), and if they would allow checksum verifications with source code in some way, then the user could update to a new version on their own once they verify and audit the code themselves, or allow time to pass for others in the community to do so, etc.
2. If I somehow knew that Apple placed an extreme level of scrutiny for certain app updates, such as hot wallets, then this would at least be something.. But I truly have no idea if they apply any more rigor when reviewing actual code changes of hot wallets vs some random game.

Or perhaps I am missing something and this is well protected against? If someone can tell me why I should not be worried about this apparent flaw in the release cycle of hot wallet code, please enlighten me. As I do think absent of this particular problem, hot wallets can actually be very secure."

CryptoTechnology,Correctness of Merkle Tree Explanation - Princeton Book,TheDeadKeepIt,1,1738679987.0,"Hello! I am currently taking a course regarding blockchain technology and my professor has us following along the Princeton Book on ""Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies"".

[https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton\_bitcoin\_book.pdf](https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf)   (page 34-36)

Here is a youtube video covering the very same material:

[https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG\_Pj51EJb&t=1487](https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG_Pj51EJb&t=1487)

Now I am taking issue with the Merkle Tree explanation provided in this book. However to question material provided by Princeton would seem inconceivable. So I would like to ask this subreddit for clarification before I make a fool of myself in front of my professor. But I genuinely understand this book to be misrepresenting the merkle tree structure. I would APPRECIATE your feedback to my post and let me know what you think. Have I misunderstood something? Is the book making an error?

Ok, on to the material. Here is a direct quote from the book.

>Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. These blocks comprise the leaves of our tree. We group these data blocks into pairs of two, and then for each pair, we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks. These data structures make the next level up of the tree. We in turn group these into groups of two, and for each pair, create a new data structure that contains the hash of each. We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.

Here is a corresponding figure presenting a merkle tree structure from the book:

[https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png)

REBUTTAL:

The specific grievance is:

>we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks.

I claim this is not the case(with sources provided later). I claim the data structure(parent node) that is made for each pair contains the hash of the concatenation of the children. So if there is a pair of leaves A and B, the parent node does NOT contain two hash pointers for each leaf which is written as H(A) H(B) in the book's diagram. Instead, it contains a single hash of both A and B concatenated, that is  denoted as H(A||B).

Further, there are no pointers which let you instantly hop from the parent to its children. The only way to find the child given a parent in practice is by using index arithmetic because all of the nodes in a binary tree can be denoted using indexing. And indexing follows a structure that lets you navigate the tree.

I claim the above misunderstanding leads to a further misunderstanding regarding a proof of membership. As I understand, a proof of membership is the same as a proof of inclusion and a merkle proof.

Here is the text from the book:

>Proof of membership. Another nice feature of Merkle trees is that, unlike the block chain that we built before, it allows a concise proof of membership. Say that someone wants to prove that a certain data block is a member of the Merkle Tree. As usual, we remember just the root. Then they need to show us this data block, and the blocks on the path from the data block to the root. We can ignore the rest of the tree, as the blocks on this path are enough to allow us to verify the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. See Figure 1.8 for a graphical depiction of how this works.

Here is a diagram they provide:

[https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png)

REBUTTAL: Consider a trivial example of a merkle tree where it contains 3 nodes.  It has a root. The root has 2 children(leaf nodes in this case). Also assume a merkle tree is structured as I claim: The leaf nodes contain hashes of their corresponding datablocks. The parents of these leaf nodes contain the hash of the concatenated child hashes. And any further parents are recursively constructed in the same fashion.

Given this simple case, let the datablocks be denoted as A and B. Then one leaf node contains H(A) and the other contains H(B). The parent contains the hash H( H(A) || H(B) ).

I want to prove the membership of the datablock A. The book claims I need only provide the direct path from root to leaf node of A. And I claim this is NOT enough information. Suppose I do as the book states and provide the root and the leaf node containing H(A). First providing the leaf node H(A) is actually redundant. Anyone can fabricate the correct hash of a datablock on the fly. What we really want is a piece of information that confirms H(A) is indeed part of this tree where the hashes propagate upward to the root - and where the root is combined authenticator for all the elements in the tree. Ok so maybe adding the root will provide enough information? If I observe the hash stored in the root which is the output of H(H(A)||H(B)). Well this is NOT helpful! How can I confirm that H(A) was propagated upwards into the root and passed into a hash with H(B) concatenated. I have H(A), but I'm missing half of the input so how can I possibly reproduce the output of H(H(A)||H(B)) to verify? The only way to verify would be if I was provided H(B).

I claim the information that must be provided are the sibling nodes along the direct route from leaf to root which contradicts the claims in the book.

CryptoTechnology,Why Prediction Markets Will Be the Future of Crypto,EventX_Official,73,1738442494.0,"Crypto has gone through a lot of trends—Bitcoin as “digital gold,” Ethereum and smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and whatever else people have hyped up. But one of the most interesting (and underrated) use cases is prediction markets. I honestly think they could be a huge part of crypto’s future.

# What’s a prediction market?

It’s basically a way to bet on real-world events—elections, sports, stock prices, anything. If you think something will happen, you buy “Yes” shares. If you think it won’t, you buy “No” shares. The price moves based on what people believe the probability is. It’s like a stock market for real-world events.

# Why does this matter for crypto?

* They’re actually useful – Instead of just trading meme coins, prediction markets provide real-world value by showing what people *really* think will happen.
* Less censorship – A lot of places ban certain types of betting (especially political betting), but decentralized markets are harder to shut down.
* One of the best real uses for crypto – People always ask what crypto is actually *good for*. This is one of the best answers.
* Better than traditional betting – No middlemen, lower fees, and the odds are set by the market instead of bookies.

Platforms like Polymarket and Augur are already doing this, but it still feels early. If crypto is going to have real-world applications, **prediction markets could be one of the biggest.**

Curious to hear what others think—are prediction markets the next big thing, or is something holding them back?"

CryptoTechnology,Bitcoin and XRP Discussions,Both-Mushroom8283,82,1737932530.0,"Hey everyone,

I'm planning to get in the market in a bit after researching quite a while about bitcoin and xrp. Both really fascinates me and believe both could co exist in the future to create the future of financial technology.

This is what I got and please correct me if I have mistakes and I'm open for discussion down in the comment sections so feel free! 

**Key Differences Between Bitcoin and XRP Algorithms**

**Consensus Mechanism**:

* **Bitcoin**: Uses **Proof of Work (PoW)**, where miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. This process is **energy-intensive** and relatively **slow**.
* **XRP (Ripple)**: Uses the **Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)**, which relies on a network of **trusted validators (Will talk about these later)** to reach consensus on transactions. It is **faster**, more **energy-efficient**, and does not require mining.

  
**Transaction Speed**:

* **Bitcoin**: **10 minutes** on average due to the time required to mine each block.
* **XRP**:  **3-5 seconds** due to its lightweight consensus algorithm. Very fast.

  
**Scalability (TPS-wise)**:

* **Bitcoin**: Processes about **7 transactions per second (TPS)**. Scaling has been a challenge due to its block size and consensus model (?)
* **XRP**: Can handle up to **1,500 TPS**, making it more suitable for large-scale, high-frequency use cases like global payments.

  
**Purpose**:

* **Bitcoin**: Designed as a **decentralized digital currency** and store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold.""
* **XRP**: Primarily developed as a **bridge currency** for cross-border payments and facilitating fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions.

# Combined Benefits for Financial Technology:

1. **Improved Efficiency**: Bitcoin’s decentralization and XRP’s speed/low cost can complement each other in creating hybrid systems that are both secure and scalable.
2. **Reduced Costs**: Both cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies in transaction and operational costs between countries.
3. **Innovation in Payment Systems**: By integrating blockchain technology, Bitcoin and XRP can inspire new solutions for digital payments, lending, and ""**ASSET""** tokenization.

  
Some questions that I have:

1. Can both co-exist with each other later?  
2. Is XRP decentralized or centralized?  

* Validators on the XRP Ledger include universities, financial institutions, and independent organizations, making the network less reliant on Ripple Labs.
* Since Ripple Labs created XRP and still holds a significant portion of its supply (over 40 billion XRP in escrow). This concentration of ownership can give Ripple Labs significant influence over the XRP market, defeat the purpose of decentralized currency like bitcoin.

  
Please correct me if I have any mistakes and I hope we could learn from each other :) Thank you!"

CryptoTechnology,Verifiable AI with TEEs and Blockchain,rayQuGR,83,1736769224.0,"AI systems are becoming increasingly powerful, but how can we trust their outputs and ensure they’re processed securely? Oasis Protocol is addressing this by combining Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with blockchain technology to deliver verifiable AI.

Here’s how it works:

* **What Are TEEs?** TEEs are secure hardware environments that isolate sensitive data and computations, protecting them from unauthorized access or tampering. Think of them as a vault for processing data while keeping it private.
* **Blockchain Integration**: By coupling TEEs with Oasis’s blockchain, computations performed inside these secure enclaves can be verified using cryptographic proofs. This guarantees that the AI models and their outputs haven’t been altered.
* **Why It Matters**: This combination enables decentralized applications to maintain both transparency and privacy, solving a key issue for industries that rely on sensitive data, such as:
   * **Healthcare**: Securely analyzing patient data without exposing it to breaches.
   * **Finance**: Ensuring fraud detection algorithms operate as intended without bias or interference.
   * **Government and Compliance**: Proving compliance with regulations while maintaining data confidentiality.

Oasis Protocol is paving the way for AI systems to gain trust in critical applications where verifiability is essential. By leveraging TEEs, they ensure computations are not only private but also provably correct—offering a balance of security and accountability.

CryptoTechnology,Blockchains algorithm full privacy ,EvilCorpRobot,371,1736085088.0,"Hello Reddit!

I'm excited to share with you all an innovative approach to blockchain security and privacy that I’ve been working on. The core idea of this algorithm is to enhance both transaction confidentiality and user anonymity without compromising the integrity of the blockchain itself. This is achieved primarily through the use of pseudonyms for each transaction, and I'd love to explain how it works!

Key Features:

1. Pseudonyms for Sender and Receiver:
Every transaction on the blockchain involves a pseudo-generated public address for both the sender and the receiver. These pseudonyms are essentially temporary identities tied to a private key that can only be used for that specific transaction. By doing so, the blockchain ensures that there is no direct link between the user’s real-world identity and their on-chain activities, enhancing privacy.

2. Transaction Fragmentation:
Transactions are fragmented into smaller parts that are independently validated, meaning that even if parts of the transaction are intercepted, it becomes nearly impossible to reconstruct the full transaction. This ensures extra layers of security and privacy.

3. Dual Validation by Two Groups of Miners:
To further enhance security, two separate groups of miners validate different aspects of each transaction. This reduces the risk of malicious actions and ensures that the integrity of the transaction is always maintained.

4. Cryptographic Protections:
I’ve incorporated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), ring signatures, and other advanced cryptographic techniques to guarantee that transaction details remain private while still allowing for secure verification on the blockchain.

Why Pseudonyms?

The use of pseudonyms in this system allows for complete privacy—even when transactions are verified, there is no way to trace back the transaction to any real-world identity unless the user explicitly reveals it. This is a key feature for anyone concerned with maintaining their privacy in a blockchain environment.

Additionally, it provides a layer of security against tracking and surveillance by making it incredibly difficult to correlate transactions between different pseudonyms, even if they are used by the same person.

What’s Next?

I’m hoping to take this concept further and eventually bring it to the real world. The system is designed to be scalable, meaning it can grow alongside the adoption of blockchain technology while maintaining privacy and security for all users.

If you’re into blockchain tech, privacy, or cryptography, I’d love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!

CryptoTechnology,"[Thoughts on my idea]: Using blockchain to create ""proof of impact"" for charity donations
",mattsworrld,120,1735355270.0,"I'm aiming to solve a problem within philanthropy of mismanagement of resources/lack of transparency when using funds that are donated.

I'm brainstorming an idea which would be a platform where charities would have to issue some sort of NFT to each donor, which would allow donors to see direct proof of how their donations made an impact.

For example, if someone donated $10 for 10 trees to an organization that plants trees, the charity would issue 10 unique NFT's (via smart contract) to prove that these trees have actually been planted (via geotag for the exact coordinates, a photo or something else- not important in this example). This would serve as a ""proof of impact"" and would provide transparency in how funds are managed and donations used.

Users (donors) would have a platform to see their contributions, project updates, fund allocation, and milestones achieved in real time.

We would charge a % of each donation as a fee, but I'm still exploring if this idea is even viable and needed.

IMO people are much more willing to donate when they can see what they're getting for the money, and therefore getting donors to use our platform shouldn't be a problem; and the charities would be attracted to use our platforms with the access to additional donors.

This has use cases beyond large charities, it can be used to crowdfund projects (like Kickstarter), or individual donations (like gofundme).

Is this an idea worth pursuing?"

Take Bitcoin it gets so much heat for its energy consumption, but some argue it’s actually pushing renewable energy adoption forward. Then there’s Ethereum, which moved to PoS and cut its energy use massively. But does that centralize power among big stakers? Feels like it’s a tough trade-off either way.

CryptoTechnology,Why I Don’t Think Crypto Can Replace Banks: The Trust Problem,LividElevator1134,6,1734785232.0,"Why I Don’t Think Crypto Can Replace **FIAT**

After extensive research and reflection on cryptocurrency, I believe that nearly all technologies in the cryptosphere won’t succeed. The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: **trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.**

Crypto overlooks the need for **oversight and intervention**. Without it, systems become dangerously exploitable. Crypto wallets often lack government IDs and use irreversible, sometimes untraceable transactions, making them prime targets for theft. As adoption grows, so might scams, threats, and violence. Without oversight, crypto can also be used to hide and launder money, promoting tax fraud and other criminal behavior.

Traditional bank accounts, in contrast, incorporate measures like withdrawal limits, fraud detection, transaction traceability and reversibility, and compliance checks (KYC and AML). These safeguards require centralized authorities with power and thus DeFi lacks foundational security.

Some argue that crime is minimal relative to total crypto transactions. Yet crypto grants users the freedom to commit these crimes if they choose, and the ease of doing so could incentivize tax fraud and other crimes. So while I admit privacy is important, your actions can’t be totally anonymous. Crypto is akin to having no police in a city.

Users are also fully responsible for their private keys, and that responsibility often leads to lost or accidentally destroyed wallets. Proper storage means creating multiple backups and maintaining a highly secure physical environment—no small task, especially when millions of dollars could be on the line. For most people, it simply isn’t practical or safe to manage that level of risk themselves. The sensible solution, in my view, is to rely on a centralized, trustworthy entity—i.e., a bank.

Hopefully, this illustrates the flaws in DeFi and why banks and governments remain necessary. For those who still believe a trustless blockchain is the solution where users bank themselves, remember that today’s “trustless” blockchains aren’t truly trustless. Oracles—offchain data sources that link onchain—cannot be verified cryptographically. While aggregation from multiple oracles can reduce risk, collusion remains possible.

The uncomfortable truth is that **trust is indispensable, despite its imperfections.** Instead of eliminating trust, we should focus on making our institutions more trustworthy—a far simpler approach. To replace TradFi, crypto would need to replicate thousands of centralized features in code—fraud resolution, asset recovery, tax compliance, oracle verification, criminal law, and more. This would require an enormous infrastructure of decentralized nodes running millions of lines bug-free code, making complex, nuanced decisions—well beyond current technology. And since “code is law,” human intervention would be nearly impossible when mistakes occur.

Maybe once we reach AGI, decentralized altruistic AI agents could run the financial system. Until then, I remain skeptical that most cryptocurrencies have any real, lasting value.

EDIT: I wrote this post right before learning that OpenAI announced o3, which some say is AGI 🙊 

There’s a lot I didn’t say because this is long enough but I think there is some good in blockchain via taking elements of it and applying them to centralized, permissioned systems. That would give us the best of both worlds. Happy to engage with you all in the comments :) Also I used ChatGPT to polish this just a lil bit."

CryptoTechnology,Which coins are technologically superior to Bitcoin?,Vex-Trance,27,1734603569.0,"Bitcoin came first to the scene and that is a big reason behind its high market cap, right? There must be other crypto that are technologically superior. Now I am assuming whichever crypto is closer to solving the blockchain trilemma is technologically superior.

For a blockchain to be successful on a global scale, it must have a good handle on:

* Decentralization
* Security
* Scalability

However, as things currently stand, one of these three factors are being sacrificed to some extent to achieve two of the others. This is what's called the blockchain trilemma.

I did a few internet searches and found the following names floating around when it comes to cryptos that are closer than others to solving the blockchain trilemma:

* Polkadot (DOT)
* Cosmos (ATOM)
* Nano (XNO)
* Algorand (ALGO)
* Hedera (HBAR)

What do you think? Now there could be criteria other than the ability to solve blockchain trilemma that can be used for determining technological superiority, if you think so I'd love to hear about that.

People get into crypto to trade and make quick money. And that's alright. But I am thinking which crypto could potentially overtake Bitcoin on basis of technological superiority/better utility in the future."

To be fair, I wasn't really thinking about this until very recently when I was reading about a few projects on CMC, but the way the ecosystem is setup, most users have no control over how their data is used or even monetized by tech companies.

We also cannot overlook the fact that personal data is usually vulnerable to breaches or misuse, and even if you decide to monetize your data, the average user lacks access to tools or platforms to participate in the data economy.

Although the project I was reading about, one that Bitget already listed VANA, mentioned enabling users to contribute their data to Data DAOs, which gives them ownership and control over their digital footprints. Which also means users can tokenize their validated data, turning it into a financial asset, all via their platform.

CryptoTechnology,Trying to understand how it all works!,BareBonesTek,7,1733967343.0,"Hi,,

I'm doing some research at the moment for some work I need to complete and I have some quetions that I am struggling to find answers to. Can anyone here help? These mostly relate to scaling.

1. We all know that multiple copies of the complete chain are held on mutiple machines (some explanations say ""by every device participating in the chain"" although I suspect thst is not really the case!) So, my first area of interest is the size of the chain / data storage requirements. I have no idea how much disk space a single block takes up, but that is largely irellevant. If a particular chain is old and popular, surely it wil evenbtually grow to a size that makes it impractical? Can anyone comment?
2. The classic explanation of how a cryptocurrency works, is that the chain represents a ledger of all transactions. In order to figure out a particular address's balance (to see if they have enough to make a transaction) the explanation then basically states that the whole chain / ledger is scanned for transactions involving that address to calculate the balance. So, related to Q1, how is that done efficiently? I mean, if I have a chain that is (say) 10 years old, with several tens of billions of transactions in the ledger, wouldn't searching the chain for every transaction involving a particular address take an impractical amount of time? (Say, I have a waller running on my smartphone, how can it perform that search efficiently?) Or is there some clever algorithm in play here?
3. How is the ""winning"" miner decided upon? Regardless of ""proof"" somehow one entitly must ""win"", sign the block, add it to the chain and claim the reward? Again, say we have several thousand miners (and nodes) it's not unreasonable for more thsan one to get a solution before consensus can be reached. Given that the whole point is to have no central control, who gets to decide? Doesn't network latency get in the way?
4. I have a basic understanding of ""Proof of Work"" and how thi has led to a crazy amount of power being used on a glovbal scale for mining operations, but how do other systems work (""Proof of Stake"" / ""Proof of Storage"" etc.) and why are they more efficient? Do they also not have to ""solve"" the block in the same way that PoW systems do?
5. Who actaully executes smart contracts? By which I mean, where is the code actually run? Is it the miner? If so, how do we ensure that if the contract references external entites, it is only done once?

Thanks for reading this. Any insights you can offer would be greatly appreciatedf!"
CryptoTechnology,"Found my Crypto Niche, Please Advise Further Research",TaciturnlyLoquacious,2,1733923982.0,"Hello all,

I'm a few months into crypto, and as the title says, I think I've finally found my crypto niche - the thing that really gets me excited and makes me a believer in this space. While I am continuing to broaden my understanding about crypto and the blockchain, I'm really interested in recommendations for some more specific research. Right now I have a massive funnel of information and I'm basically choking on it all.

What really interests me is the potential for crypto and the underlying tech to make private equity and venture capital obsolete, as businesses, creators, and developers are able to use tokens to leverage their community as investors who want to directly support products/people/ideas they believe in and cut out the middle men of VC/PE and wall street (I currently hold stock in some VC/PE firms registered as BDCs because that's as close as I can get to those market opportunities, and also the whole ""accredited investor"" thing is BS, but I digress.) - something in between crowd funding and IPOs that are superior to both.

I had an ""aha"" moment when I was learning about how smart contracts have been used to code royalties into NFTs and stuff, and realized that this technology is vastly superior to the current way that basically the whole stock market operates. In my hopium-fueled future, shareholder agreements are coded on the blockchain and stock is replaced with tokens - and obviously not just stocks, but all sorts of asset classes, IP, etc, that most people don't currently have good access too.

I believe this is referred to as ""tokenization"" - but I'm still learning all the vocabulary - and also there seem to be a lot of different players out there talking about tokenization as part of their use case, but I'm not sure they all mean exactly the same thing or have the same vision for what that looks like.

If anyone could recommend specific cryptos that are working on this use, I will happily dive into them. I would prefer better known projects as opposed to deep-in-the-weeds altcoins, but if you think the technology is really compelling then I'm happy to look at it and learn even if only for my own edification and better understanding.

The four that I am currently studying are Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot - not specifically for what I mentioned above, but because they're the ones that are on my current reading list, although they all do seem to have some aspect of tokenization to them (opinions on these welcome).

Thanks in advance!

CryptoTechnology,A quantum computers effect on Bitcoin mining,Sargeinchage37,4,1733870669.0,"I did some digging but couldn’t find any answers related to this hypothetical question.

From my research, it clear quantum computers are a long way from cracking the encryption algorithms Bitcoin uses. However, technically if an algorithm existed today, a quantum computer could start mining Bitcoin. I’m guessing that a quantum computer could calculate the target hash much faster than all the traditional computer on the network so the difficulty of the target hash would need to increase to maintain the 10 minute block target.

If my assumptions about the process above are correct (feel free to correct if I am misunderstanding), I’m curious what would happen to Bitcoin if this quantum computer stopped mining. Would the block creation process come to a halt since the traditional computers remaining on the network would not be able to calculate a hash of such difficulty?"
CryptoTechnology,Working on a crypto system for privately buying digital goods. Need suggestions and feedback!,MAKEMONEYSMOKEASS,5,1733686408.0,"Hi everyone!

I’m working on a **privacy-focused project** and would love to get your feedback. The idea is an escrow platform where:

1. **Sellers submit a decryption key** to the escrow system.
2. Buyers negotiate a deal (likely on a third-party platform).
3. Once payment is confirmed, the decryption key is securely released to the buyer.
4. The platform includes a **rating system** for buyers and sellers to build trust.

Key Features:

* No files or documents are stored on the site. Only a decryption key for said item.
* Even if I wanted to investigate what’s being bought or sold, I wouldn’t be able to, since the files and transactions are separate. So 100% anon.
* The system relies entirely on the **validity of the key** and the buyer’s ability to decrypt their file.

# My Concerns:

I’m worried there might not be enough demand for a system like this. It seems like there are limited use cases where total anonymity is essential.

* Do you think this is a dumb idea?
* Are there specific use cases or scenarios where this would make sense?
* What would make you trust such a platform?

Say you want to buy a digital good (e.g., a license key, encrypted document, or script) in complete privacy. The seller won’t just send it to you because they can’t be sure you’ll pay. That’s where our site comes in:

The seller encrypts the digital good and submits the **decryption key** to our site. The actual encrypted file remains wherever they choose—Dropbox, a USB stick, email—completely outside our platform. Once you’ve sent payment and it’s confirmed, the system releases the decryption key to you. You can then use the decryption key, on the encrypted file inorder to recieve your product.

1. **Trust**: The seller is guaranteed payment, and you’re guaranteed the decryption key.
2. **Anonymity**: Since we never handle or store the file, even we couldn’t determine what’s being bought or sold.
3. **Security**: The process is entirely focused on the key, leaving the file’s storage up to the buyer and seller.

Only thing missing is the buyer needs to trust the seller, this I would use a rating/comment system for.

  
I’d really appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions. "

CryptoTechnology,Cere Network vs. Filecoin: Is Cere the Next Step in Decentralized Data and Storage for Web3?,SpacKingz,5,1732134252.0,"I’ve been diving deep into decentralized storage solutions, and I’ve been impressed with Cere Network’s approach to solving some of the key limitations of Filecoin. While Filecoin has made huge strides in the decentralized storage space, Cere Network’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) offers some unique advantages that I believe could make it a more scalable, private, and efficient alternative in the long term. Here’s why:

1. True Decentralization:

	•	Filecoin operates with a reliance on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which, while a powerful tool, still has issues around centralized bottlenecks—specifically, reliance on specific nodes for data retrieval. Cere Network is building its own decentralized storage layer, aiming for seamless on-chain data management, ensuring true decentralization without these limitations.

2. Optimized for Scalability & Speed:

	•	While Filecoin is good for long-term data storage, it struggles with real-time, high-speed data access, which is essential for Web3 applications and especially AI-driven projects. Cere’s DDC is engineered for high-throughput and low-latency access, enabling not just storage but real-time data sharing that’s critical for modern applications.

3. Privacy-Focused for Enterprises and AI:

	•	Cere offers a far more robust approach for enterprises looking to securely share and manage sensitive data, whereas Filecoin lacks the same level of privacy integration. With data privacy becoming an even bigger issue, especially in AI development, Cere’s architecture allows secure data sharing, which is vital for the next-generation Web3 applications and AI algorithms.

The AI Angle & Potential Data Marketplace:

One of the most exciting aspects of Cere Network’s infrastructure is its potential to create a decentralized data marketplace. This could be a game-changer, especially as machine learning and AI continue to grow exponentially. Here’s how:
	1.	Decentralized Data for AI Training:
Cere’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) could be the foundation for a marketplace where custom datasets are bought and sold. AI models need massive, high-quality datasets to train on, but often, acquiring these datasets in a decentralized manner is complex and expensive. Cere Network could allow individuals or companies to upload, sell, or share their data securely, creating a new market for customized datasets that can be directly accessed by AI developers and machine learning practitioners.
	2.	Access to High-Quality Data for Machine Learning:
Many organizations struggle to find curated datasets that are specific to their machine learning models, leading to delays and inefficiencies. With Cere, people could monetize their data in a way that is secure and transparent, providing AI developers with access to diverse, high-quality datasets that would previously have been difficult to acquire. This opens up new opportunities for cross-industry collaborations, allowing AI models to become more powerful and specialized.
	3.	Data Ownership and Control:
One of the major issues in the current landscape is data ownership. In many cases, the owners of valuable datasets (such as companies or individuals) don’t have control over how their data is shared or monetized. Cere’s infrastructure ensures that users can retain ownership of their data while still participating in a marketplace, where they can choose to license or sell access to it. This would ensure fair compensation for those providing data while fostering a new market for AI companies and machine learning developers.

Local Node Deployment and Custom Clusters:

Another groundbreaking feature that Cere Network offers is the ability to spin up local nodes and create custom clusters, giving users and developers the power to personalize their infrastructure in a way that is scalable and efficient. Here’s how this can revolutionize decentralized storage and data usage:
	1.	Spin Up Local Nodes:
	•	Cere’s flexibility allows anyone to set up local nodes on their own hardware. This is a huge benefit because it reduces dependency on centralized providers and creates a truly decentralized ecosystem where users can participate from their own servers. Whether you’re an enterprise or an individual, the ability to host nodes locally means that Cere’s network can grow organically across different regions without relying on centralized cloud services.
	2.	Customizable Data Clusters:
	•	Cere goes beyond just providing data storage. It allows users to build and configure custom clusters that meet their specific needs—whether that’s handling particular types of datasets, optimizing for machine learning workloads, or even tailoring the storage configuration for specific AI applications. This is a huge advantage for developers looking for more control over their infrastructure and those who require high-performance data access for complex tasks.
	3.	Seamless Scalability for Enterprises and AI:
	•	As demand for data increases, being able to scale your local node infrastructure is key. Cere Network provides an easy way to expand clusters dynamically, ensuring that enterprise-level applications, especially those leveraging AI and machine learning, have access to unlimited scalability without being constrained by traditional centralized models.

Why This Could Be a Game-Changer:

With the rise of AI, the demand for large-scale, diverse, and privacy-compliant datasets is skyrocketing. Cere Network isn’t just building a decentralized storage layer; it’s positioning itself as a deep layer infrastructure project that could lay the foundation for a global decentralized data marketplace. By creating an ecosystem where data providers and AI developers can securely exchange data, Cere can unlock a massive revenue stream while also driving forward the development of AI.

By allowing custom node setups and the ability to deploy clusters locally, Cere can offer unmatched scalability and flexibility for decentralized data storage. This could lead to the creation of a decentralized infrastructure capable of handling the most demanding AI applications, enabling developers and businesses to access data on their own terms.
